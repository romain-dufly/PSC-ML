13455397,Basins of attraction and equilibrium selection under different learning rules,"In symmetric two-by-two games, basins of attraction are invariant to a wide range of learning rules. The existence of parasitic or misleading actions allows subtle differences in the learning rules to accumulate.","A deterministic learning model applied to a game with multiple equilibria produces distinct basins of attraction for those equilibria. In symmetric two-by-two games, basins of attraction are invariant to a wide range of learning rules including best response dynamics, replicator dynamics, and fictitious play. In this paper, we construct a class of three-by-three symmetric games for which the overlap in the basins of attraction under best response learning and replicator dynamics is arbitrarily small. We then derive necessary and sufficient conditions on payoffs for these two learning rules to create basins of attraction with vanishing overlap. The necessary condition requires that with probability one the initial best response is not an equilibrium to the game. The existence of parasitic or misleading actions allows subtle differences in the learning rules to accumulate.",2009.0

In reality, the duration of each activity is uncertain with a distribution, instead of a constant number. The cost of each activity may vary when the duration of the activity changes, generating different Net Present Value.","Critical Path Method (CPM) is widely used in construction engineering scheduling. Through calculating Early Start (ES), Early Finish (EF), Late Start (LS), and Late Finish (LF), the duration of a project can be obtained, and critical path can be found. However, in reality, the duration of each activity is uncertain with a distribution, instead of a constant number. Meanwhile, the cost of each activity may vary when the duration of the activity changes, generating different Net Present Value (NPV). In this paper, a Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) methodology is introduced to deal with the uncertainty-based time-cost trade-off (TCT) analysis in construction scheduling problem. An example is stated to verify the proposed methodology.",2010.0
214765293,Creating a geodemographic classification model within geo-marketing: the case of Eskişehir province,This study performed a geo-demographic segmentation of the urban neighbourhoods of Eskiehir province and sought to determine the characteristics of the people living in these neighbourhoods at the household level. Groups created using the SPSS package program and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis were then mapped on the GIS platform as urban neighbourhoods.,"Abstract Businesses today face great competition in their operations, making it necessary for them to adopt a “customer-oriented” approach. In this competitive environment, where customers are more valuable, enterprises accrue great advantages from an understanding of the characteristics of the target audience in all dimensions. This is where the importance of geo-marketing and demographic segmentation for enterprises emerges. This study performed a geo-demographic segmentation of the urban neighbourhoods of Eskişehir province and sought to determine the characteristics of the people living in these neighbourhoods at the household level. The Groups created using the SPSS package program as well as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis were then mapped on the GIS platform as urban neighbourhoods.",2020.0

151210879,Solar energy and public utility rate regulation,It is suggested that solar energy users must be able to resort to the public utilities as a backup source of energy when their solar systems do not provide for all their energy needs. It is suggested that solar energy users must be able to resort to the public utilities as a backup source of energy when their solar systems do not provide for all their energy needs.,"It is suggested that solar energy users must be able to resort to the public utilities as a backup source of energy when their solar systems do not provide for all their energy needs. An introduction to the regulatory process is given. Part I of the article is divided into three sections: (1) nature of demand costs and influence of solar backup service; (2) how the total costs (customer costs, energy costs, demand costs) are allocated to various customer classes; and (3) how allocated costs (particular demand costs) are built into the utility rate structures used to calculate the charge to each customer. Together (2) and (3) demonstrate that the potentially high cost of solar backup service is a function of both demand costs and cost allocation. Part II provides arguments that conversion to solar power can proceed without threatening existing utilities. Time of use rates (significantly higher rates for on-peak than for off-peak service) would be the most understandable and acceptable to the public and provide an economic incentive for greater use of solar energy. 105 references.

It is submitted that a formalisatiion of case law based on these concepts has greater explanatory power than the prevailing approaches currently found in textbooks and policy instruments.,"EU competition law is increasingly informed by economic analysis. However, the tools of this discipline are rarely ever used systematically for positive purposes. This article gives a unifying picture of art. 101(1) TFEU judgments based on familiar economic concepts (market failures and transaction costs). It is submitted that a formalisatiion of case law based on these concepts has greater explanatory power than the prevailing approaches currently found in textbooks and policy instruments. The article shows, first, that the availability of an efficeincy explantion for an agreement is the default starting point followed by EU courts when drawing the line between restrictions of competition by object and by effect. Secondly, it explores how market failures and transaction costs influence the analysis of restrictive effects on competition under art. 101(1) TFEU. These insights are equally userful to define the scope of art. 101(3) TFEU and the relevance of non-economic considerations.",2012.0
151215678,Empirical Examination of debt and growth nexus in South Asian countries,"South Asian countries have been facing a twin deficit and need to rely on public external and domestic debt to finance their developmental activities. The consequences of public debt for economic growth and investment are examined for Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The results suggest reliance on debt for development purposes is not a safe option.","Over the years, South Asian countries have been facing the problem of a twin deficit and the need to rely on public external and domestic debt to finance their developmental activities. The positive impact of public debt relates to the fact that in resource-starved economies debt financing, if done properly, leads to higher growth and adds to the borrower’s capacity to service and repay external and internal debt. The negative effect works through two main channels, namely “debt overhang” and “crowding out”. In the present study, the consequences of public debt for economic growth and investment are examined for the four countries in South Asia, namely Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, for the period 1975-2011. To conduct the study, a hybrid model that explicitly incorporates the role of public debt in growth equations was developed. The standard panel data estimation techniques have been used. The results show that both public external debt and debt servicing negatively affect economic growth and investment, which points to the existence of the “debt overhang effect” and the “crowding out effect”. Similarly, domestic debt also exhibits a negative and significant relationship with economic growth and investment. The results suggest that reliance on debt for development purposes is not a safe option and countries need to extend the efforts to increase the revenue to finance the development expenditure.",2014.0

Learning about the historical dynamics of yields led to substantial variation in RA's subjective risk premiums. Moreover, she gained substantial forecasting power by conditioning her learning on measures of disagreement among professional forecasters about future yields. This gain was distinct from the (much weaker) forecasting power of macroeconomic information. RA's views about the pricing distribution of yields remained nearly constant over time. Her learning rule outperformed consensus forecasts of market professionals, particularly following U.S. recessions.",2018.0

Banks that can adopt and absorb the new technology faster will have a competitive edge over rivals.,"Abstract: Initiation of Information Technology and Communications networking system is set to change the operating environment of banks drastically. Technology has already enabled some of the banks to introduce innovative products to their customers in the form of ATM facility, Telebanking, Home Banking, 'Anytime' and 'Anywhere' banking, etc. Technology can also be harnessed in automating and networking the branches that will ensure timely flow of information and aid decision making process .The banks that can adopt and absorb the new technology faster will have a competitive edge over their rivals. The changes brought about by IT (Information Technology), new products, more sophisticated customers, changing cost structures, and enhanced competitive pressures have all combined to transform the structure of the banking industry. And with further development of new technologies, the industry will likely continue to evolve. Customers of banks have felt the positive impact of technological solutions implemented by banks. The customers of banks of today have a virtual menu of options as far as delivery channels are concerned and all these are the benefits of technology. With the most visible benefits happening in the areas of payments for retail transactions, a variety of cards, Automated Teller Machines, Electronic based funds transfers, Internet banking, Mobile banking are all some of the latest technology based payment solutions, which have gained large acceptance amongst the Indian banking public. With technological solutions rapidly evolving, more new products and services may soon become the order of the day. Though infrastructure and communication advancements remain an area of concern, in the rural areas, standards are being formulated to make banking a secure and pleasant experience and banks have bridged the divide caused by distances by offering ‘Anywhere and Anytime banking’.",2012.0

An investment strategy that buys Democracies and shorts Dictatorships earns abnormal returns of around 18% annually during the sample period. In this paper we investigate if Corporate Governance matters in investorsâ€™ decisions. We try to observe if Corporate Governance is a proxy for firm valuation, a factor of creating and altering abnormal returns, or a risk factor, which can be a â€œsubstituteâ€ for market risk (beta), using uni- and multi-variate analyses.

But, in general, the relevant trade-offs associated with the preservation option are not well known. The absence of a framework capable of relating theoretical and operational aspects is a restriction for understanding the subject of biodiversity. If we cannot measure it, there is no way to take rational actions to get preservation because each one (preservation and non preservation) brings expected gains and current losses of welfare for the society. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology that gives a value to the price for the preservation of biodiversity, by the adaptation of the approach developed by Montgomery et alii (1999). Summing up, this study tries to find the confidence interval for the value of willingness to pay for lump sum tax paid by society to take the preservation program for some endangered species. The viability or probability that the species remain alive in the future, the degree of genetic diversity and the use value are the elements, among others, involved in this process.",2002.0

152573350,THE OIL CRISIS: THIS TIME THE WOLF IS HERE,"U.S. could remain essentially self-sufficient in oil, as late as 1970, it was believed that the U.S. could remain essentially self-sufficient in oil. In the long run, the only satisfactory position for the U.S. must be alternative sources of energy.","It was a popular belief in the 1960s that the supply of oil was abundant. As late as 1970, it was believed that the U.S. could remain essentially self-sufficient in oil. Recognizing the dangers of dependence on oil from the Eastern Hemisphere, a Presidential Task Force recommended that imports from the Eastern Hemisphere be limited to 10% of total U.S. oil consumption, a level expected to be reached in the mid-1980s. These projections were spectacularly wrong. Imports from the Eastern Hemisphere amounted to 15% of consumption in 1972, and are expected to rise to 20% in 1973. The source of these errors were: (1) overestimates of domestic capacity, and (2) the decline of natural gas supplies and its impact on oil demand. Most of the world's proven oil reserves are in Arab hands. We must recognize that previous political threats on restriction of oil have been directed against the U.S. alone, not against our allies. By 1980, we will be even more dependent on oil from the Middle East. The present price agreements are defined only thorugh 1975. Production is leveling off in the Middle East. The only alternative to shortfall before 1980 will be Saudi Arabia, and its projected production seems improbably high. The U.S. has discussed a two-pronged approach to consumer cooperation: (1) development of new forms of energy, and (2) an international authority to avoid cutthroat competition in times of shortage. In the long run, the only satisfactory position for the U.S. must be alternative sources of energy. Effective mass-transit systems could do much to limit our present profligate use of energy in the form of oil.",1973.0

Profit models are constructed which involve four price/cost components; selling prices, cost from accepted nonconforming item, reprocessing and inspection costs.","Individual items are produced continuously from an industrial process. Each item is checked to determine whether it satisfies a lower screening limit for the quality characteristic which is the weight of an expensive ingredient. If it does, it is sold at a regular price; if it does not, it is reprocessed or sold at a reduced price. The process mean may be adjusted to a higher value in order to reduce the proportion of the nonconforming items. Using a higher process mean, however, may result in a higher production cost. In this paper, the optimal process mean and lower screening limit are determined in situations where the probability that an item functions well is given by a logistic function of the quality characteristic.

152575385,The Private Bond Case as a Postponement of the Real Issue,"The case of Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R. is found to contain many important implications which have passed unnoticed. In particular, the ""necessary and proper"" clause and the Fifth Amendment as a substantive check thereon will inevitably become a portentous struggle.","The discussion which immediately follows a significant Supreme Court ruling often emphasizes its political and economic effects; and if any respectable chain of reasoning can be found to serve the purpose, a decision expedient from an economic angle becomes ""correct"" from a legal point of view. Moreover, it is widely recognized that in the field of Constitutional Law the Court may escape the past without restricting the future by somewhat forced construction and a ""proper"" selection from among competing analogies. The existence of this process and the desire of the critic to approve a practically desirable result combine to minimize the importance of a single decision as a source of Constitutional Law. Yet in the long run the true significance of the case may prove to be that it furnishes points of reference on which the Court, if it chooses, may later rely. Viewed in this latter sense, as a precedent for the future rather than a result socially desirable for the present, the case of Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R.' is found to contain many important implications which have passed unnoticed. In particular, if, as seems altogether likely, the process of extending federal powers continues, the ""necessary and proper"" clause and the Fifth Amendment as a substantive check thereon will inevitably become the focal points of a portentous struggle. An attempt will be made in the following pages to subject the Norman case to careful analysis with a special view to these implications. The plaintiff's bond in this case provided that payment of principal and interest would be made in gold coin of the standard of weight and fineness existing when the bond was issued. A joint resolution of Congress declared invalid all contract provisions, past or future, which purported ""to give the obligee a right to require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency, or in an amount in money of the United States measured thereby. . . 2 The first section of Mr. Chief Justice Hughes' opinion deals with the interpretation of the clause in the bond. With the issues involved in this matter we are not here concerned. Suffice it to say that, while discarding the theory that the contracts were for gold as a commodity, or bullion, the Chief Justice also denied by implication the contrary contention that they were for gold coin and nothing else. They were, he concluded, ""gold value"" contracts,",1935.0
152575432,The Impact of Index and Swap Funds on Commodity Futures Markets PRELIMINARY RESULTS,Using Granger causality methods the study finds no significant relationship between changes in index and swap fund positions and increased market volatility.

158220988,"Tax havens, income shifting, and redistributive taxation","This paper investigates the effects of tax havens on nonhaven countries’ redistributive policies. The presence of havens gives rise to the mobility of tax bases, which may increase the tax rate.","This paper investigates the effects of tax havens on nonhaven countries’ redistributive policies. We consider that a nonhaven country contains individuals with different labor productivities. A tax is imposed on the income, and the revenues are evenly distributed. The tax rate is determined by majority voting, which reflects the median voter’s preferences. The presence of havens gives rise to the mobility of tax bases, which may increase the nonhaven country’s tax rate in two ways. First, it leads to a median voter with a lower productivity; second, it may enlarge the marginal tax revenue from raising the tax rate. In addition, we find that a stricter antihavens regulation may lower the tax rate. We further show that income shifting is likely to reduce the amount of the transfers. The case of tax evasion is also taken into consideration.",2019.0

158223283,Road to Industrialized Africa: Role of Efficient Factor Market in Firm Growth,"Industrialization has lost ground with shrinking manufacturing sector and high informality in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using data on firm balance sheets for 40 countries in SSA, the results identify significant land and labor misallocations. Local average treatment effects show large productivity gains from factor reallocations, especially for marginally productive firms.","After a decade of rapid growth, industrialization has lost ground with shrinking manufacturing sector and high informality in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This paper explores how land market and labor regulations affect factor allocative efficiency and firm performance in SSA. Using pooled data on firm balance sheets for 40 countries in SSA, the results identify significant land and labor misallocations due to limited market allocation of land and inappropriate regulatory policies. Using variations in ethnic diversity and the intensity of regulatory actions to peer firms at subnational level as instrumental variables, local average treatment effects show large productivity gains from factor reallocations, especially for marginally productive firms. Panel data results for Nigerian firms confirm factor market inefficiency as a principal driver of declining productivity, while showing that the 2011 minimum wage reform increased firm size. The results imply that improving formal regulation is critical to support firm growth at the stage of weak legal capacity, while informal sector monitoring gets effective as legal capacity develops.",2018.0

The study has taken the risk as a phenomenon to explore its influence on ex-post TC in construction projects. The study recommends substantial investment in human capacity development to reduce the deficiencies in the ex-ante phase of the projects that help to reduce the risk of ex-post TC escalation.,"The transaction cost (TC) escalation is the pervasive problem in the construction industry, which is continuously a threat to maintaining the life cycle cost of projects. Researchers have described the reality of risk for economic transactions. This study has taken the risk as a phenomenon to explore its influence on ex-post TC in construction projects. A questionnaire survey was undertaken from industry professionals to assess the risk of ex-post TC escalation in public-sector construction projects. In total, 475 surveys were conducted in Pakistan and used in the analysis. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) and the measurement and structural model was validated to determine the influence of risk on ex-post TC. The final SEM results show that internal and external risk, including sub hypothesized risks, positively influence TC. The weight of relative importance shows technical risk (23.82%) and environmental risk (22.88%) as significant sub-contributors from internal and external sources, respectively. This study recommends substantial investment in human capacity development to reduce the deficiencies in the ex-ante phase of the projects that help to reduce the risk of ex-post TC escalation. It also suggests the adoption of strict policies on contingency claims, and recommends nontraditional ways of monitoring to overcome the risk of ex-post TC.

158226927,The Revival of Balkanization: How Externally-Driven Reforms Reinforce the Fragmentation of Governance in South Eastern Europe,The study shows externally-driven good governance reforms improve substantive legality. The implication is that externally-induced reforms are reproducing Balkanization and bad governance. A quantitative indicator-based analysis measures the development of good governance across six dimensions between 2003 and 2015.,"What impact does the European Union (EU) and other international donors have on the development of good governance in South Eastern Europe (SEE)? The comparative analysis shows that the externally-driven good governance reforms improve substantive legality (the alignment of domestic legislation with international best standards), state capacity and efficiency but weaken formal legality (the inner morality of law), many aspects of impartiality and the coherence of state structures and policies. As a result, good governance is undermined. To explain the persistence and reproduction of bad (i.e. fragmented) governance, the author offers a “vicious reform cycle” explanation, in which a fragmented governance structure is reproduced by competing and factionalized actors and by fragmented and politicized reform and policy processes. The implication is that externally-induced reforms, instead of allowing to transition towards good governance, are reproducing Balkanization and “bad governance”, i.e. fragmented, unaccountable, personalized and instable state structures, policies and formal rules. The main argument is supported by a mixed method study. A quantitative indicator-based analysis measures the development of good governance across six dimensions between 2003 and 2015. Qualitative interviews (with judicial and political representatives from SEE, the EU and international organizations), relevant data and secondary sources offer revealing insights on processes of hybridization and fragmentation.",2017.0

We propose a modified version of the J test to formally select the interaction matrix. We find the interaction matrix based on trade flows is the most adequate.,"The interaction matrix, or spatial weight matrix, is the fundamental tool to model cross-sectional interdependence between observations in spatial autoregressive models. However, it is most of the time not derived from theory, as it should be ideally, but chosen on an ad hoc basis. In this paper, we propose a modified version of the J test to formally select the interaction matrix. Our methodology is based on the application of the robust against unknown heteroskedasticity GMM estimation method, developed by Lin and Lee (2010). We then implement the testing procedure developed by Hagemann (2012) to overcome the decision problem inherent to non-nested models tests. An application of the testing procedure is presented for the Schumpeterian growth model with worldwide interactions developed by Ertur and Koch (2011) using three different types of interaction matrices: genealogic distance, linguistic distance and bilateral trade flows. We find that the interaction matrix based on trade flows is the most adequate.",2019.0
158227665,Household structure and its impacts on nuptiality and fertility.,Most Egyptian population in urban and rural areas live in nuclear families. Widowed women were the most likely among all women to be household heads. Prevalence of nuclear families should be encouraged to increase age at marriage and reduce the level of fertility.,This study aimed at investigating household structure in Egypt and its impacts on nuptiality and fertility using data from the 1976 and 1986 censuses and the Egypt Follow-Up Survey of 1981-82. Type and size of household were used as measures for household structure. The results showed that the majority of the Egyptian population in both urban and rural areas live in nuclear families. Although the average Egyptian household was not large consisting of 4.9 persons in 1986 it was quite large in extended families especially in rural areas. The majority of household heads were currently married older men. Widowed women were the most likely among all women to be household heads. Widowed women aged 35-44 years had the highest headship rate among all women. The average number of active persons in Egyptian households was small (1.4 persons). More than 75% of household heads participated in the labor force. The proportion of young heads who were under age 15 was relatively high (18%). Women who lived in non-nuclear families after marriage married at lower ages and exhibited higher fertility than those who lived in nuclear families. Prevalence of nuclear families should be encouraged to increase age at marriage and reduce the level of fertility of couples. Recommendations were: expanding and strengthening the programs designed to reduce the level of fertility; increasing employment opportunities to increase the number of active household members; and promoting the status of women through socioeconomic measures which could have favorable impacts on their marriage age and reproductive behavior.,1988.0
158228712,THE IMPACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PROTECTION WITH HETEROGENEOUS WORKERS ON WAGES: EVIDENCE FROM THAI MANUFACTURING,The study assessed the impacts of international trade and protection on wage premiums across Thai manufacturing industries. The results were significant and consistent with the theorem that previous studies predicted.,The study assessed the impacts of international trade and protection on wage premiums across Thai manufacturing industries by recognising that workers are heterogeneous in their skills.The author derived a theoretical model from Ohnsorge and Trefler (2007) that is the equilibrium model with heterogeneous skill bundles and estimated the model using micro data from Thailand. The results showed that tariffs and NTBs are indicators of protection that have negatively significant effect on wage premiums. Exports and imports are indicators of international trade measurement. Exports exert positively significant impacts whereas imports have negatively insignificant impacts on the wage premiums. The results are significant and consistent with the theorem that previous studies predicted.,2014.0

While all of these species routinely make decisions in the context of social cooperation and competition, they have different socio-ecologies, which leads to different predictions about how they will respond. Our prediction was that anti-matching would be more difficult than matching in a symmetric coordination with simultaneous moves. To our surprise, not only do rhesus macaques frequently play one asymmetric Nash equilibrium, but so do capuchin monkeys, whose play in the coordination game was literally not distinguishable from randomness (in simultaneous play). Humans are the only species to play both asymmetric equilibria in a repeated game.",2017.0
139086171,Innovative Crisis Management in Construction: Approaches and the Process☆,The study describes the concept of crisis management in the construction industry and introduces related objectives and characteristics. The study attempts to reveal how construction firms can manage crises better and turn to their former positions in the short term.,"Abstract Crisis management is a process that includes catching and evaluating crisis signals and needs to take and implement necessary precautions in order to overcome a crisis with a minimal damage. Detecting the early warning signals of a crisis contributes firms to hinder the occurrence of the crisis and to survive without huge financial losses. Other factors that contribute construction firms to survive with zero defect can be listed as follows: (i) catching indirect signals before a crisis, (ii) developing proactive methods to defend themselves against the crisis by means of these signals, (iii) taking the crisis under control, (iv) taking required measures after the crisis for the recovery of the firm, and lastly (v) recording the lessons learned from the crisis. Construction firms that can successfully manage a crisis can quit it with a minimum loss and can expand their market shares after the crisis. In other words, firms that can escape from a crisis with zero or minimum damage may strategically have competitive advantages over existing rivals. Considering all these issues, this study describes the concept of crisis management in terms of the construction industry and introduces related objectives and characteristics. In addition, both innovative crisis management approaches and the corresponding process were discussed in detail from the perspective of construction companies. In fact, this is a virgin area in the construction management literature and thus can contribute to the creative and innovative management of companies under potential crises in micro and macro levels. Consequently, this study attempts to reveal how construction firms can manage crises better and turn to their former positions in the short term through innovation-based means.",2015.0

Amprenavir/abacavir/abacavir resulted in median plasma HIV-1 RNA reductions of 1.8 log10 copies/ml.,"OBJECTIVE ::: To evaluate the antiretroviral activity and safety of multiple escalating doses of amprenavir administered alone, and in combination with abacavir in HIV-1-infected adults. ::: ::: ::: DESIGN ::: Sixty-two HIV-1-infected subjects were enrolled in a multicentre, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalating trial. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Subjects were assigned to one of six dose groups and received amprenavir 300 mg twice daily, 300 mg three times daily, 900, 1050, or 1,200 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. One dose group received amprenavir 900 mg twice daily in combination with abacavir 300 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Antiretroviral activity was assessed by measuring changes from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 cell counts. Safety was evaluated by monitoring clinical adverse events and changes in laboratory values. Genotypic and phenotypic analyses were performed using ABI sequencing and the recombinant virus assay, respectively. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: At week 4, amprenavir monotherapy (900, 1,050, or 1,200 mg twice daily) resulted in marked decreases in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (1.3-1.6 log10 copies/ml), and substantial increases in CD4 cell counts in the two dose groups who received 1,050 mg twice daily (118 x 10(6) cells/mm3) or 1,200 mg twice daily (114 x 10(6) cells/mm3). Amprenavir/abacavir resulted in median plasma HIV-1 RNA reductions of 1.8 log10 copies/ml, and median CD4 cell count increases of 138 x 10(6) cells/mm3. Amprenavir was reasonably well tolerated with few treatment-limiting adverse events. No known active site mutations associated with amprenavir resistance were selected in any of the dose groups, and no significant phenotypic resistance to amprenavir developed during 4 weeks of therapy. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The antiviral effect of amprenavir monotherapy increased with escalating doses, and all amprenavir doses were reasonably well tolerated over 4 weeks of therapy. Amprenavir/abacavir combination therapy elicited a potent antiviral effect. The three highest doses of amprenavir (900, 1,050 and 1,200 mg twice daily) were selected to design subsequent Phase II and III studies that confirmed the safety profile and efficacy of amprenavir in combination regimens and led to the approval of amprenavir in the USA in 1999.",2001.0

This is a case study for other middle income nations in Southeast Asia.,"Violent video games have been linked to being one of the causes for increased aggressive behaviour and juvenile crimes in many developed and developing societies. This exploratory study investigates the effects of high income and gender on playing violent video games in Malaysia, and how it results in poor academic performance amongst secondary school children. This is a case study for other middle income nations in Southeast Asia, which also have strong Eastern cultural and religious beliefs. Contrary to earlier findings, the results indicated that boys from higher income backgrounds had a higher propensity for playing violent video games than adolescents from lower income backgrounds. The same effect though, is not manifested on adolescent girls. Nevertheless, playing violent video games was positively related to trait aggressive and negatively to academic performance in both the sexes. Our findings shed new light on socio-economic and demographic factors influencing violent video gaming, offering insig...",2014.0

We introduce cybernetics as a perspective that puts such feedback effects at the centre of attention and provides an accessible sequential framework for analysing them.,"Feedback in foreign policy occurs when a state's foreign policy affects the international context of that state and those changes in context subsequently impact on the state's future foreign policy decisions. In this way, feedback loops can develop, which may become self-reinforcing and in which foreign policy and international context continuously affect each other. Even though such processes are ubiquitous especially in a globalized world, they have hitherto received little systematic attention. We introduce cybernetics as a perspective that puts such feedback effects at the centre of attention and provides an accessible sequential framework for analysing them. Such a cybernetic analysis not only demonstrates the significance of feedback processes in foreign policies but also speaks to several recent debates in international relations theory and foreign policy analysis.

They include transitions from a centrally planned to market economy, from a closed to an open economy, and from a manufacturing and export-driven to a more consumption- and innovation-led growth path. It also describes the main features of the socialist market economy with ‘Chinese characteristics’ including the gradual ‘step-by-step’ approach in the economic reforms in the different production sectors of the economy. In particular, the financial reforms that were given a major boost in the early 1990s and still require the necessary deepening of the current transition to a more sustainable economy are discussed. This chapter also elaborates on the adverse consequences of the rapid growth model and China’s incomplete transition to a market economy. The traditional development model caused a huge depletion of natural resources, serious environmental pollution, which hindered the sustained economic development. Special emphasis is given to some current problem areas in the housing and stock market; the huge local government and increasing corporate debt; and the capital flight and excess capacity described in their relation with the current inevitable economic slowdown which could be seen as a breeding ground for new initiatives where the BRI can be seen as an important example and is central to this pivot.",2019.0

The distributional analysis is conducted for Italy as a whole and for the twenty Italian regions.,"This chapter studies the redistributive effects of the Italian personal income tax by using novel individual tax returns. The application of a decomposition of the reranking term shows that the set of personal income tax instruments can have different effects on vertical and horizontal equity. The distributional analysis is conducted for Italy as a whole and for the twenty Italian regions in order to add a new dimension of inquiry to the study of regional income disparities in this country. Results for the two main tax expenditures for the owner-occupied house, the deduction for the main residence and the mortgage interest tax credit, throw new light into the total redistributive consequences of such tax expenditures in Italy. It is found that, the mortgage interest tax credit, a tax measure often criticised at both national and international level, has a small, positive effect on vertical equity, but it has negative consequences on horizontal equity. A discussion of the pros and cons of using administrative tax data for studying redistribution is also provided",2019.0

From the research status in this field, most scholars only use intelligent algorithms to optimize the disassembly sequence, and rarely evaluate the performance of obsolete products. On the basis of summarizing the existing research, this paper establishes a comprehensive disassembly evaluation model based on the fruit fly algorithm, crossover efficiency and extension-gray correlation degree. Firstly, a set of Pareto solutions is obtained by IFOA, and the group of 12 disassembly schemes is used as the decision-making unit (DMU) of the DEA. The average DQ of the 12 disassembly schemes was 5.4, the average EB was 387 CNY, and the average PDR was 83%. Then, the final cross-efficiency model is obtained by improving the traditional average cross-efficiency method. It is evaluated the performance of the comprehensive indicators of the disassembly plan in terms of time, economy and environment, and obtained their respective rankings. After the normalization process calculated, DMU4 (0.0714) has a relatively higher ultimate weight than DMU10 (0.0581). The analysis results show that the disassembly scheme evaluation result is the best overall performance of N4. Finally, the same case is used to execute three optimization algorithms. The results show that IFOA has better optimization and sensitivity than the other two algorithms.",2020.0
14946076,The Macroeconomic Transition to High Household Debt,"Aggressive deregulation of the household debt market in the early 1980s triggered innovations that greatly reduced the required home equity of U.S. households. In 1982, home equity equaled 71 percent of GDP; so this generated a borrowing shock of huge macroeconomic proportions. The combination of increasing household debt from 43 to 56 percent of GDP with high interest rates during the 1982-1990 period is consistent with such a shock to households’ demand for funds.","Aggressive deregulation of the household debt market in the early 1980s triggered innovations that greatly reduced the required home equity of U.S. households, allowing them to cash-out a large part of accumulated equity. In 1982, home equity equaled 71 percent of GDP; so this generated a borrowing shock of huge macroeconomic proportions. The combination of increasing household debt from 43 to 56 percent of GDP with high interest rates during the 1982-1990 period is consistent with such a shock to households’ demand for funds.

We first characterize the perfect Bayesian equilibrium in cutoff strategies. We then show that there exists a unique threshold such that if the reseller’s bargaining power is greater (less) than the threshold, resale allowance causes the leading bidder (the following bidder) to have a higher (lower) incentive on entry; i.e., the cutoff of entry becomes lower (higher).

The average tort award increases as black and Hispanic county population rates increase and especially as black and Hispanic county poverty rates increase. An increase in the black county poverty rate of 1 percentage point tends to raise the average personal injury tort award by 3–10 percent. An increase in the Hispanic county poverty rate of 1 percentage point tends to raise awards by as much as 7 percent, although this effect is less well estimated. Forum shopping for high‐poverty minority counties could raise awards by hundreds of thousands of dollars. Average awards decrease with increases in white (nonblack, non‐Hispanic) poverty rates in two of our data sets, making these findings even more surprising. Awards increase with black and Hispanic county poverty rates even after controlling for a wide variety of other potential causes.",2003.0

The results demonstrate support for independent group-level effects of intrateam support on adaptive and proactive recovery behavior, indicating that perceptual consensus within service teams has incremental value in explaining service recovery performance. In addition, we provide evidence that adaptive and proactive recovery behavior have differential effects on external performance measures. More specifically, higher levels of adaptive performance positively influence customer-based parameters (i.e., service recovery satisfaction and loyalty intentions), while employee proactive recovery behavior contributes to higher share of customer rates.",2004.0
157920628,Unquenchable Thirst for Gold: India's Gold Problem,Imports of gold into India have been a drag on the rate of economic development. The gold imports seem to serve as a glittering border to our poverty.,"Imports of gold into India have been a drag on the rate of economic development of the country for the last few centuries, India is a poor producer of gold and gold in India has been an imported or foreign commodity, a fact that had not been understood neither by the propenents of the old Swadeshi Movement nor the present day Swadeshi Manch. (Gold imports absorb a significant part of the meagre savings of a poor country in an unproductive way and also lead to increased foreign indebtedness. A statistical exercise for the period 1873-98 shows that if during that period India had refrained from importing gold the rate of increase of GDP would have been significantly higher and foreign indebetedness of India significantly lower than what it was. Indian demand for gold is mainly for making arnament to wear and seems to be deeply embedded in Indian culture. It is very difficult to control. A ban on gold imports by Government is largely ignored as the history of the period 1947-91 shows. It only encourages smuggling. During 1981-1990 smuggled gold into India accounted for the loss of S 14 billion in foreign exchange. If gold had not been imported during this period, there would have been no foreign exchange crisis in 1991 and no need would have arisen for borrowing $ 3-4 billion from the World Bank. The gold imports seem to serve as a glittering border to our poverty, a cultural cost which makes our fight against poverty so handicapped.",1996.0

Q-Learning acts as the learning mechanism for light at each intersection as an independent agent to release itself by operating traffic light duration dynamically.","Traffic light control is an issue that metropolitan cities are confronted with because of ever-increasing vehicles growth. A proper timing strategy can release the congestion level and minimize vehicle delays better than standard fixed signal timing (FST) strategy. In this paper, a self-adaptive Q-learning based traffic light green time control strategy (QTGCS) is designed to reduce the congestion. Q-Learning acts as the learning mechanism for light at each intersection as an independent agent to release itself by operating traffic light duration dynamically. Q-Learning is based on discrete representation of state and action spaces. In order to make QTGCS not independent of the environment and designer criterion, Fuzzy Q-learning based traffic light green time control strategy (FQTGCS) is proposed by applying the fuzzy logic control to optimize timing strategy based on the number of vehicles receiving from the adjacent intersections.

157921158,Players' Agents and the Regulatory Framework on Corruption in International Sports Law,"The increased commercialization of sports has led to growth in the demand for expertise. The perception of the profession has developed in line with the commercialization of sports. In the United States, the profession came into prominence in the 1960s and 1970.","1. Introduction 1.1. Description of the thesis and the subject During the last decade we have seen a significant commercialization in sports all over the world. The sports stars of today are earning more than their predecessors could even dream of. an illustrating example can be seen in football where star players like Jimmy Greaves and Dennis Law earned a little more 20 BP a week in the 1960s, whereas one of today's top players, Zlatan Ibrahimovich, is paid around 170000 BP per week under his current contract with Inter Milan. (1) Even compensated for the inflation, this example illustrates the tremendous increase of money circulating in many sports today compared to relatively recent times. The increased commercialization has lead to growth in the demand for expertise when deals are concluded among the various stakeholders in football, thus giving birth to the profession called sports (players') agents. In a global perspective the perception of the need for this profession has developed in line with the commercialization of sports. In the United States, where the commercialization of sports started prior to the European, the profession came into prominence in the 1960s and 1970. (2) In Europe, agents faced greater skepticism and for a long time clubs and managers refused to negotiate with players that used agents. The following quotation from the legendary manager Brian Clough gives a good indication of the how the atmosphere was during his era (1975-1993) as coach: ""If a player had said to Bill Shankly 'I've got speak to my agent', Bill would have hit him. and I would have held him while he hit him"". (3) However as the transactions have become more and more complex and involve more and more money the profession has gained terrain also in Europe the last 20 years, and today you will hardly see a transfer where an agent is not involved in one way or another. Sociological studies have shown that changes in a business sector such as we have seen in International sports will generally call for the creation of a regulatory framework. (4) That this is the case in sports today is inter alia observed by Beloff, a reputable scholar and practitioner in the field of sports law, that describes the increased legalism as a natural function of raised financial stakes produced by increased sophistication, particularly of a technological nature, and by a ready market fueled by the demands of a public whose craving for sports appears insatiable. (5) Thus we have recently seen many incentives to regulate sports agents. However, the International dimension complicates the legislative process because in addition to the questions of how the profession should be regulated, the crucial question of competence arises. In International sports law there are three tiers of agent regulation today, namely: International law, national law and the law of the sports bodies. (6) Between these tires there are problems connected to jurisdiction and contradictions giving rise to conflicts of law requiring one to consider, firstly; the substantive question of whether or not a conflict exists, and secondly; which set of rules will prevail in case of a conflict between the set of rules. 1.2. Terminology, scope and the further structuring of the analysis. 1.2.1. Corruption According to the Miriam Webster dictionary corruption can be defined as: ""impairment of integrity, virtue or moral principle; depravity, decay, and/or an inducement to wrong by improper or unlawful means, a departure from the original or from what is pure or correct, and/or an agency or influence that corrupts"". (7) This wide definition that will be used in the following covers a broad range of activities. With regard to Players' agents accusations of corruption normally arises because the agent makes-or at least is accused of having made-use of means that are contrary to norms deriving from one of the 3 tires of legislation that governs the profession in order to facilitate a transfer. …",2009.0

The large quantity of imports indicates economic disorder. The root level research on the family decision making of gold purchases would serve understanding the decision criteria of the need, resource utilization, place of buying and reality.","Golden era is seldom illustrated for an epitomized growth of anything for a tenure and India having been topped the list in the consumption of gold, cannot be proved to be safer for the economic turmoil is ahead with current account deficit. Gold is a symbol for the fortune and treated as a cultural trait especially by Indian families coated with traditional thinking where the usages and purchases are escalating year by year. The innumerable efforts of the Government in the way of schemes and reforms have not been considerably successful and as a result, the large quantity of imports indicates economic disorder. Though many parties and players from different communities including the Government are responsible, the root level research on the family decision making of gold purchases for different purposes such as for ornaments, appreciation, investment, security and status would serve understanding the decision criteria of the need, resource utilization, place of buying and reality.

By disclosing its own projection the central bank reduces the disagreement among the forecasters the most in the periods when the economy moves from one phase of the business cycle to another.","This paper examines to what extent public information provided by the central bank affects the forecasts formulated by professional forecasters. We investigate empirically whether disclosing GDP and inflation forecasts by Narodowy Bank Polski (the central bank of Poland) reduces the disagreement in professional forecastersâ€™ expectations. The results only partially support the hypothesis on the coordinating role of the central bank existing in the literature. The main finding is that by publishing its projection of future GDP growth, the central bank reduces the dispersion of one-year-ahead GDP forecasts. Moreover our study indicates that the role of the central bank in reducing the forecasts dispersion is strengthening over time. We also find using non-linear STR models that the extent to which the projection release affects the dispersion of GDP forecasts varies over the business cycle. By disclosing its own projection the central bank reduces the disagreement among the forecasters the most in the periods when the economy moves from one phase of the business cycle to another. On the contrary, the release of CPI projection by NBP affects neither the cross-sectional dispersion nor the level of forecasts formulated by professional forecasters.",2015.0

The research is generally found that the most of Pakistani manufacturing listed firms pursue good corporate governance mechanism and use good level of Capital Mix to get the better and high financial performance.","The key purpose of this research paper is to explore the moderating effect of Corporate Governance on the relationship between accounting base financial performance i.e. ROA, and ROE and Capital Structure of 173 Manufacturing firms listed in KSE of Pakistan for the period of 2009 to 2014. In this study multiple regression method is used under fixed effect regression model approach on panel data. The empirical results show that the inclusion of Corporate Governance Index (CGI) as moderating variable has influenced the interaction between Capital Structure and Financial Performance which was positively significant. The result is generally found that the most of Pakistani manufacturing listed firms pursue good corporate governance mechanism and use good and optimal level of Capital Mix to get the better and high financial performance. Furthermore, the corporate governance sub-indices i.e. board structure (BOD-I) and transparency & disclosure (DISC-III) both also have positive and statistically significant association with both firms performance variables: ROA and ROE. Moreover, the ownership structure sub-index (OWS-II) has not significant influence on financial performance. In last, the capital structure also has positive relationship with financial performance, interestingly about 70 per cent of Capital is financed by Equity capital and the Debt capital signifies 30 per cent only.

Our aim is to maximize the service level achieved for a given total amount of safety stock. Most previous research considering MRP environments has been empirical or heuristic, but the approach we take is analytic and concentrates on two network types: serial and divergent networks. Using previous results on the MRP ordering logic, we show that in serial networks the optimal policy positions all safety stock at the end stock-point. This result is independent of the stochastic nature of the demand, the type of uncertainty and the measure of service used. The analysis of divergent networks is more complicated because of the need for material rationing. We show that the optimal policy may depend on the total amount of safety stock available, the variability of the demand, the structure of the lead times, the choice of the rationing policy and the measure of service used.",1993.0

Thus, there are three different kinds of approaches of waste management that are concurrently used in Taiwan: fee-per-bag, mandatory recycling with free waste collection services, and the zero price of trash collection. We performed a comparative analysis of these policy instruments to take advantage of this important social experiment. We first developed an economic model for the three different waste charging programs concurrently in use and then performed an empirical study based on the implications from the theoretical analysis. It is clearly seen that the traditional approach of zero pricing of trash collection is very ineffective in terms of waste reduction and recycling. Households have all changed their behavior significantly in those cities with two new approaches. However, of the two, the fee-per-bag program is clearly the most effective approach.

In the key wind energy regions, there is potential to develop a succession of large wind-farms. In the '90s the government target of 1 GW for the wind-power capacity to be installed by the year 2000 was lowered to 620 MW.","China's wind energy potential ranks highly in the world scale. In the key wind energy regions, there is potential to develop a succession of large wind-farms of up to several hundreds of MW capacity. In the '90s the government target of 1 GW for the wind-power capacity to be installed by the year 2000 was lowered to 620 MW. In 1994, three government bodies, the then State Planning Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, and the State Economic and Trade Commission, created the long-term Development Programme for Renewable Energies for the years 1996–2010. In 1996, the new Electricity Law of the PRC, declared “… the State encourages and supports electricity generation by using renewable and clean energy resources”. However, key energy objectives of China's Ninth Five Year Plan (1996–2000) reflected the continuing dominance of coal, oil and gas in China's energy policy-making. Between 1993 and 1997, wind generating capacity installed in China had risen from 17.1 to only 167 MW, while capital and operating costs for wind generated electricity (1998) were still too high in relation to coal and hydro generation. The 10th-Five Year Plan aims to promote more environment-friendly power generation including hydropower development in the western region. The plan will allocate more natural gas and renewable energy for power generation. With no value being ascribed to inherent cleanliness of wind energy, electricity produced from this relatively immature sector continues to need higher prices than that from entrenched, mature fossil-fuel-based power generation. In China this has contributed to a perception that wind is a niche-market resource, primarily relevant to remote rural areas which conventional power grids are not able to reach economically. Expansion of wind energy to a larger role runs into opposition from newly liberalised power networks who are more than ever concerned, and required, to keep the cost of supplies as low as possible. Within these limitations, some success has been and still is being achieved in buying down the costs through technical and scalar innovation in a growing number of grant-aided projects. For greater penetration to be achieved, a market needs to be created for wind energy. There is recent evidence in Europe and the United States that realistic incentives can encourage industry to consider much larger wind-power development projects with consequent improvement to the economics. Competitive bidding from wind-energy development companies can ensure that the targets are met at lower cost. A system of competitive bidding for licence areas (or concessions) for areas big enough to support very large wind-power plants, and chosen from prime wind regions by government, can be issued, regularly for bidding, as in oil and gas development. An accompanying institutional framework such as the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) is essential. China is considering introducing a trial mandated market share (MMS) intervention, based on RPS for a selected region to assess its applicability to both China nationally and the renewable energy sector as a whole. There is a case for enactment of an encompassing Renewable Energy Law, which will provide a point focus for regulating renewable energy development, setting any RPS/MMS levels within time-frames and with all related modalities, including green certificate trading. An electricity price in the region of 4.5–5.0 USC/kWh will also need to be achieved when power purchase agreements are negotiated, if the bidding process is to achieve success. Local production of hardware needs to lower capital costs by an estimated 25–30% of current (2000) costs if economic returns are to be sufficient at these price levels. A concessionary approach, linked with a renewable portfolio standard law and aimed at large projects, can help achieve a faster development and a rapid buy-down of costs of wind energy technology.",2001.0

Our research explores short-run growth in microcomputer technologies by specifying growth models and parameter estimates for six commercially important computer technologies over short time periods with weekly data. Observations were acquired in a homogeneous market, limited to a collection time frame of less than two years. Data was collected at granular, weekly intervals, with concurrent tests to determine whether parameters were stable over successively longer intervals; conversely candidate growth models from longer ‘strategic’ planning horizons were tested to determine whether they scaled down to operational planning horizons. We found that an exponential model of performance-to-price growth is supported over short time horizons in all but one microcomputer technology (nonvolatile RAM). The exponential model and technology specific parameter estimates that are valid over short horizons were found to accurately scale up to longer planning horizons. We expect our results to contribute to more accurate price-performance forecasting at the corporate and product level; better decision making concerning inventory management, capacity utilization, lead and lag times in supply-chain operations, and efficiency of logistics.",2007.0

154223421,A tumultuous decade in Thailand: competitive dynamics among domestic banks and multi-national entrants in an emerging market,"This research is a longitudinal exploratory studying the influence that multinational companies (MNC) may have on domestic firms entry rates in an emerging market. The results indicate less predictable competitive dynamics than previous research would suggest, especially in the context of emerging markets. There is also some indication that domestic banks are more responsive to institutional factors within the home country than MNCs.","This research is a longitudinal exploratory studying the influence that multinational company (MNC) entry may have on domestic firm entry rates in an emerging market. Although research on competitive exclusion suggests that MNC entrants present entry barriers to potential smaller domestic entrants, we offer an alternative scenario. That is, MNCs and domestic organisations can co-exist as separate strategic groups within an industry. In particular, when small, potential domestic firms have access to idiosyncratic resources that are less available to MNCs, these smaller entrants were successful in overcoming strong MNC entry barriers. Still, this is circumscribed by the height of entry barriers, but not to the extent alluded to in previous industry organisation analysis research. The results indicate less predictable competitive dynamics than previous research would suggest, especially in the context of emerging markets. There is also some indication that domestic banks are more responsive to institutional factors within the home country than MNCs",2013.0

This paper responds to this question by offering a nuanced re-conceptualization of external events and by identifying the mechanisms that link disruptive crises to policy change. Building from the tenets of the advocacy coalition framework and a synthesis of the crisis management and policy change literatures, this paper (1) introduces the concept of policy and geographical proximity as a means to show how different types of crises alter the incentives for policy action within policy subsystems; (2) discusses an integrated set of proposals on how geographical and policy proximity affects the prospects of change in a policy subsystem; and (3) presents hypothesized scenarios outlining plausible intervening pathways linking a crisis to changes as contingent on policy subsystem structures.",2010.0

We note that many of the conventional arguments relating to the static and dynamic gains from liberalisation are based on fragile theoretical grounds. We also show that, although new trade theory takes account of some of the complexities of international trade and although the analytical thrust of many models justifies intervention, such policy conclusions are rejected even by those at the forefront of these theories on the grounds of political economy arguments which do not stand up to careful scrutiny. Finally, we show that arguments favouring trade liberalisation are not supported by existing empirical research, which generally fails to capture the complex and ambiguous effects of liberalisation and openness.

The difference between upward and downward movements is only significant for indirect taxes.,"This paper examines the asymmetric response of the underground economy (UE) in Taiwan to an effective tax rate change. The UE size in Taiwan from 1962 to 2003 is estimated using a cash deposit ratio (CDR) approach and a currency demand approach. The impact of an increase in the effective tax rate on UE is greater than that of a decrease. In addition, the impact on the UE is stronger for direct than for indirect taxes. The difference between upward and downward movements is significant for both indirect and direct taxes in the CDR approach. However, the difference is only significant for indirect taxes in the currency demand approach.",2012.0

The model is estimated using data for each of the 50 U.S. states for the 1981-1992 period.,"Recent years have witnessed widespread media attention and policy debate regarding the causes and consequences of population flight from California. While some analysts' reports link the reversal in California migration flows to cyclical swings in the state economy, other commentaries focus on alleged deterioration in California amenities and quality of life. This paper employs a logistic migration model to evaluate the role of economic and other location-specific effects in the determination of California domestic migration flows. The model is estimated using data for each of the 50 U.S. states for the 1981-1992 period. Various simulations of the model for the California case are then undertaken to indicate the effect of evolution in economic conditions and other location-specific effects on California net migration. A baseline simulation predicated on a reversion in the state's unemployment rate, wage, and house price differentials to average levels observed in the 1981-1992 period suggests a substantial slowing in California out-migration. Further, deterioration in California location-specific fixed effects, as estimated from the otherwise unexplained portion of the acceleration of out-migration in the more recent 1989-1992 period, serves to dampen the simulated improvement in California net migration only modestly. Overall, our research findings suggest that a large part of the unprecedented and sizable domestic out-migration from California is temporary, to be largely reversed in the context of a rebound in the California economy.",1995.0

154225066,Towards Responsive Vehicle Supply: A Simulation-based Investigation into Automotive Scheduling Systems,"The benefits of responsive supply systems capable of providing customized vehicles in short lead-times have been pointed out. Using a simulation of a multi-tier supply chain-system, this paper investigates the impact of altering key aspects of the scheduling activities. The paper concludes that current vehicle supply systems are not capable of supporting BTO due to insufficient feedback between supply and demand.","Vehicle supply has traditionally been based on forecast-driven production, and a large fraction of cars has been sold from stock—a practice which incurs considerable cost in terms of stock holding and sales incentives. Derived from successes in other industries, the benefits of responsive supply systems capable of providing customized vehicles in short lead-times have been pointed out. While the theoretical discussion of such ‘build-to-order’ (BTO) strategies is well advanced, the dynamic feasibility of implementing these concepts is far from understood. Using a simulation of a multi-tier supply chain-system, this paper investigates the impact of altering key aspects of the scheduling activities with the objective of determining the scope for potential improvements in responsiveness of the supply chain. The simulation results show that current vehicle supply systems are not capable of supporting BTO due to insufficient feedback between supply and demand, as well as due to the strong reliance on forecasting in the scheduling process. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations on how to improve current scheduling systems towards increasing the content of vehicles built to customer order.",2005.0

It also sheds light on enforcement challenges for establishing private rights of action and determining liability of corporate actors.,"This paper examines the challenges posed by domestic judicial mechanisms to address the liability of natural resources companies for human rights abuses and environmentally harmful activities, through the foreign operations of their subsidiaries. It explores the conceptual difficulties underlying the notion of liability at national law for violating international norms and it highlights current challenges raised by the arguments made before the United States Supreme Court in the Kiobel case to stop victims of human rights violations from bringing claims under the Alien Tort Statute for corporate abuses committed in the territory of a foreign state. The paper raises the concern that corporate impunity for violation of human rights norms might become justified at national law by the difficulty to find sources of international law to hold corporations liable for violation of international norms. It finally sheds light on enforcement challenges for establishing private rights of action and determining liability of corporate actors, arguing that the reluctance of national courts to expand principles of corporate liability and extraterritorial jurisdiction for corporate harms might affect long-term reforms to hold natural resources companies liable for their abuse of international human rights norms.

154227690,Profitable Use of SCF in a Policy Context: the Case of Rice Stockholding in the Philippines,The Philippine agriculture is greatly affected by extreme climate events such as El Nino and La Nina. This paper highlights the importance of seasonal climate forecast information as input to the formulation of various policy decisions of the NFA.,"This paper documents the activities of the National Food Authority (NFA), particularly on rice marketing, in realizing its mandates of buying high and selling low. Because the Philippine agriculture is greatly affected by extreme climate events such as El Nino and La Nina, this paper highlights the importance of seasonal climate forecast (SCF) information as input to the formulation of various policy decisions of the NFA. Among these important policy decisions are: how much volume of paddy rice to procure from farmers to be able to defend its support price; how much volume of rice to maintain in order to achieve stability in the supply and consumer price; and how much volume of rice, as well as when is the best time, to import to be able to position the optimal level of stocks in time for the lean season. It is also argued in the paper that importation has been playing a significant role in the rice supply-demand situation of the country since 1990, making it one of the most significant government interventions in the rice sector. Based on historical data assessment, some of the worst events in the past such as the 1995 rice crisis and over-importation during the 1997-1998 El Nino could have been avoided if policy decisions, particularly on the volume and timing of rice importation, were linked to SCF. Indeed, linking crop production and import decisions more systematically with SCF would enhance the usefulness of these forecasts at a more practical level.",2009.0

154228440,No-Help-Wanted Signs and the Duration of Job Search,"This paper seeks to discover conditions under which such an increase raises the optimal duration of job search. If the distribution of wage offers is log concave, the optimal duration of job search rises with increases in no-help-wanted signs.","In standard job search models, the increased duration ofjob search in recessions is the result of workers' failure to perceive the downward shift of the wage offer distribution they face.' An alternative explanation, offered by Okun (I98I), argues that the increase in 'no-help-wanted signs', i.e. zero wage offers, in recessions raises workers' optimal duration of search. Since the increased duration of job search is explained without reference to faulty wage expectations, unemployment does not automatically return to the natural rate as workers recognise the new wage offer distribution. The effect of an increase in no-help-wanted signs (a reduction in the probability of receiving a nonzero wage offer) on the duration of search in sequential job search models is ambiguous in general (Barron, I 975). This paper seeks to discover conditions under which such an increase raises the optimal duration of job search. For this purpose, a simple job search model with no-help-wanted signs is developed in the next section.2 Section II shows that, if the distribution of wage offers is log concave, the optimal duration of job search rises with increases in no-help-wanted signs. Other circumstances that yield this result are also examined. The final section contains concluding remarks.",1985.0

It is generally argued that large-scale, integrated demonstration projects are needed as a next step toward commercialization. This paper asks why it is so difficult to get demonstration projects off the ground.","Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology is considered key to mitigating climate change by international institutions and governments around the world. The technology is considered advantageous because it may enable the continued utilization of fossil fuels while curbing carbon emissions. However, development of the technology remains slow on the ground. It is generally argued that large-scale, integrated demonstration projects are needed as a next step toward commercialization. Despite government support in several countries, few projects exist so far worldwide. This paper asks why it is so difficult to get demonstration projects off the ground. The argument is that it is not only project-specific factors that determine the feasibility of demonstration, but given the need for government support, a variety of political economy factors influence decision-making processes by policy makers and companies. The paper introduces an analytical framework developed on the basis of the political economy literature that considers six sets of factors that influence outcomes. It discusses two specific projects, Longannet in the UK and Quest in Canada, and explains why one failed and the other one is under construction.

It is based on conceptual analysis, theory building and “emic' perspective.","Purpose – This paper contends that there is a positive relationship between current globalisation, unemployment, inequality and poverty, which paves a vista for further academic discourse. Design/methodology/approach – As a meta-analytical study, the paper relied on secondary data. It is a qualitative study, which is based on conceptual analysis, theory building and “emic” perspective (authors' viewpoint). Findings – A relationship between current globalisation, unemployment, inequality and poverty should be investigated further. Unemployment increases levels of inequality and poverty within society. Although bequeathed with various names and definitions, the logics of current globalisation seem to have exacerbated the problem of global unemployment, the corollary of which is endemic inequality and poverty. Practical implications – Increases in income inequality and poverty over the past decades, can be attributed to globalisation. Therefore, within the domain of unemployment, inequality and poverty in the era of globalisation, renewed problems of global competition, job termination, wage reductions, labour immobility and technological displacement of workers, have accelerated the rate of global unemployment, the corollary of which is endemic inequality and poverty. Originality/value – The originality of this paper is that it examines the phenomenon of globalisation, unemployment, inequality and poverty, from a different perspective, which creates an opportunity for further constructive debate.",2009.0
154229616,Social well‐being and gender: post‐Soviet Estonia and the welfare state Finland,The difference between men's and women's well-being in Estonia and Finland was studied according to the subjects' perceived stress symptoms. The greater load of unpaid work of the employed Estonian women was connected with a higher level of stress.,"Recent research has pointed out the gender-blindness of mainstream discussion on social well-being, social policy and citizenship. In this article the differences between men's and women's well-being in Estonia and Finland were studied according to the subjects' perceived stress symptoms within their work-family arrangements. While paid work is expected to be the responsibility of both genders in both countries, unpaid work is expected to be the main responsibility of women in Estonia, and the shared responsibility of both men and women in Finland. The results support the hypotheses about the different gendered outcomes of social policy in these countries. The greater load of unpaid work of the employed Estonian women was connected with a higher level of stress. The fact that the Finnish women perceived less stress than their Estonian counterparts and that the difference between women's and men's stress level in two-earner families with children was smaller in Finland than in Estonia, supports previous research illustrating the more women-friendly character of Finnish social policy.",1997.0

The standard of efficiency is how an irrigation district manager should optimally invest in improving the irrigation efficiencies of individual farms located along a stream while internalizing intrabasin allocative externalities of these investments.,Agricultural water conservation statutes are emerging in the West encouraging private irrigators to improve on-farm irrigation efficiency as a basinwide conservation measure. We investigate whether private improvements promote the economic efficiency and conservation of water use basinwide under a wide variety of hydroeconomic circumstances. The standard of efficiency is how an irrigation district manager should optimally invest in improving the irrigation efficiencies of individual farms located along a stream while internalizing intrabasin allocative externalities of these investments. The results indicate that the popular Oregon legislative model may be the least effective in conserving water and promoting economically efficient water allocation.© 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

56271519,Collaboration between competitors' NPD teams: in search of effective modes of management control,"Successful collaboration between new product development teams maintained by competitors (so-called horizontal NPD collaboration) requires the use of formal modes of management control that simultaneously coordinate the teams' interdependent development activities and encourage their cooperative behavior. This study draws on organizational theory of management control and develops a conceptual framework that specifies the impact of one partner's use of input, process, and output controls on the other partner's perception of coordination effectiveness and cooperative behavior.","Successful collaboration between new product development (NPD) teams maintained by competitors (so-called horizontal NPD collaboration) requires the use of formal modes of management control that simultaneously coordinate the teams' interdependent development activities and encourage their cooperative behavior. Nevertheless, prior theoretical and empirical research suggests that formal control modes required to improve coordination may also drive uncooperative, opportunistic behavior. To help managers in horizontal NPD collaborations select appropriate control modes, this study draws on organizational theory of management control and develops a conceptual framework that specifies the impact of one partner's use of input, process, and output controls on the other partner's perception of coordination effectiveness and cooperative behavior. The results of a scenario-based experiment with 110 expert practitioners show that managers perceive the competitor's use of input control as harmful and process control as helpful for achieving coordination effectiveness. Moreover, managers respond positively to the competitor's use of input control and negatively to the competitor's use of output control when it comes to cooperative behavior. Together, the results indicate that no single mode of formal management control simultaneously enhances both coordination and cooperative behavior in horizontal NPD collaborations.",2016.0

56274471,The Textility of Making,"Making is a practice of weaving, in which practitioners bind their own pathways or lines of becoming into the texture of material flows. In both cases, making is a matter of finding the grain of the world's becoming and following its course.","Contemporary discussions of art and technology continue to work on the assumption that making entails the imposition of form upon the material world, by an agent with a design in mind. Against this hylomorphic model of creation, I argue that the forms of things arise within fields of force and flows of material. It is by intervening in these force-fields and following the lines of flow that practitioners make things. In this view, making is a practice of weaving, in which practitioners bind their own pathways or lines of becoming into the texture of material flows comprising the lifeworld. Rather than reading creativity 'backwards', from a finished object to an initial intention in the mind of an agent, this entails reading it forwards, in an ongoing generative movement that is at once itinerant, improvisatory and rhythmic. To illustrate what this means in practice, I compare carpentry and drawing. In both cases, making is a matter of finding the grain of the world's becoming and following its course. Historically, it was the turn from drawing lines to pulling them straight, between predetermined points, which marked the transition from the textilic to the architectonic, debasing the former as craft while elevating the latter as technology.

We find that order-flow had a larger impact on quote revision in a relatively low-intensity trading environment than in a relatively high-intensity trading environment.,"The impact of trades on price dynamics in the European sovereign debt markets is of significant importance to policy makers and market participants. This paper uses high-frequency quote and transaction data from the MTS European sovereign bond inter-dealer platform to investigate price-order-flow dynamics from July 2005 until December 2011 for Germany, France, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Greece. We find that order-flow had a larger impact on quote revision in a relatively low-intensity trading environment than in a relatively high-intensity trading environment implying that informed traders should only execute in low-intensity trading environments when they value immediacy over discretion. This analysis is consistent with the limited prior literature for European debt markets. Our analysis indicates that this relationship persists during turbulent market conditions. Also, we find that the impact of order-flow on subsequent trades was larger during periods of high-trading intensity implying that market participants use order splitting trading strategies.",2020.0

Analysis of individual contributions indicates that subjects’ responses to asymmetry match the theoretical prediction in 3 out of 4 single asymmetry cases.,"Economic theory predicts that individuals will free-ride, providing sub-optimal Nash equilibrium quantities of public goods. However, 25 years of experimental evidence indicates that individuals’ behavior often differs from the Nash prediction. This experiment examines provision in the context of asymmetric benefits and asymmetric costs of providing a public good with declining marginal benefits and increasing marginal costs. The design eliminates the coordination problem at the individual level inherent in previous declining marginal benefit experiments. Yet, even with the improved theoretical design, over-contribution persists, suggesting that it is a behavioral phenomenon rather than a design artifact. Analysis of individual contributions indicates that subjects’ responses to asymmetry match the theoretical prediction in 3 out of 4 single asymmetry cases. Thus, although over-contribution remains, the theoretical role of asymmetry is confirmed.",2013.0

The winning firm secures a patent, protecting the invention from imitation. This paper tests the assumption made about the reward structure in patent races, both in discrete and complex industries. We identify patent race winners using detailed information from the patent examination reports at the European Patent Office (EPO). Estimates of a market value equation featuring large, R&D-intensive U.S., European and Japanese firms show that if firms win patent races, their market value increases significantly. We further show that the gain in market value is significantly larger for patent race winners in discrete industries than for firms in complex industries.",2012.0
28905751,Adoption and Use of Electronic Markets: Individual and Collective Learning,"In the traditional channel, intrinsic frictions make uncertain implementation of an exchange, but the quality of traded items is perfectly observable. In the electronic channel, exchange always occurs but agents imperfectly appreciate items' quality, because traders and traded commodities are inaccurately observable on e-markets. In this model, traders are heterogeneous regarding both their preferences and their ability to trade on the electronic market.","We investigate in this paper the problem of the dynamics of adoption of electronic commerce, focusing on agentsâ€™ expertise and learning patterns in using e-markets. Traders face a double uncertainty. In the traditional channel, intrinsic frictions make uncertain the implementation of an exchange, but the quality of the traded items is perfectly observable. In the electronic channel, exchange always occurs but agents imperfectly appreciate items' quality, because traders and traded commodities are inaccurately observable on e-markets. We develop in this paper a simulation model to deal with this issue. In this model, traders are heterogeneous regarding both their preferences and their ability to trade on the electronic market. We successively sketch two scenarii: i) We first analyse a situation where learning is strictly individual. A trial-and-errors learning pattern may have an ambiguous impact. On the one hand, it is found to improve the diffusion of electronic markets. On the other hand, it may be responsible of a new source of inequalities because some agents may not be able to trade in the electronic channel and are hence excluded from the use of this market either in the short run (temporal unemployment) or in the long run (structural unemployment). As learning is imperfect, the economy converges to a situation where the two markets coexist, inducing coordination costs (frictional unemployment). ii) We then extend our results by exploring the effects of community-based learning practices: such practices are found to enhance the adoption of the electronic channel although inequalities among agents may increase.",2004.0
6689902,Information-based network control strategies consistent with estimated driver behavior,The objective is to enhance the performance of a vehicular traffic system through real-time information-based network control strategies. The results suggest the importance of using a behavior-consistent approach to determine the information-based network control strategies. Information strategies that are not behavior-consistent can potentially deteriorate system performance.,"This study proposes a fuzzy control based methodology to determine information-based network control strategies that are consistent with the controller's objectives and its estimation of driver response behavior. It is the core of the broader problem where the objective is to enhance the performance of a vehicular traffic system through real-time information-based network control strategies. The controller seeks behavior consistency by solving a fixed-point problem that estimates drivers' likely reactions to the controller-proposed information strategies while determining them. Experiments are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results suggest the importance of using a behavior-consistent approach to determine the information-based network control strategies. That is, the effects of driver response behavior to information provision may require more meaningful strategies than those provided under the traditional dynamic traffic assignment models to reliably estimate or control system performance. Information strategies that are not behavior-consistent can potentially deteriorate system performance.",2009.0

The objective of this study is to assess the degree to which Bangladesh can be self-sufficient in terms of domestic maize, rice and wheat production by the years 2030 and 2050 by closing the existing gap (Yg) between yield potential (Yp) and actual farm yield (Ya), accounting for possible changes in cropland area. Yield potential and yield gaps were calculated for the three crops using well-validated crop models and site-specific weather, management and soil data, and upscaled to the whole country. We assessed potential grain production in the years 2030 and 2050 for six land use change scenarios (general decrease in arable land; declining ground water tables in the north; cropping of fallow areas in the south; effect of sea level rise; increased cropping intensity; and larger share of cash crops) and three levels of Yg closure (1: no yield increase; 2: Yg closure at a level equivalent to 50% (50% Yg closure); 3: Yg closure to a level of 85% of Yp (irrigated crops) and 80% of water-limited yield potential or Yw (rainfed crops) (full Yg closure)). In addition, changes in demand with low and high population growth rates, and substitution of rice by maize in future diets were also examined. Total aggregated demand of the three cereals (in milled rice equivalents) in 2030 and 2050, based on the UN median population variant, is projected to be 21 and 24% higher than in 2010. Current Yg represent 50% (irrigated rice), 48–63% (rainfed rice), 49% (irrigated wheat), 40% (rainfed wheat), 46% (irrigated maize), and 44% (rainfed maize) of their Yp or Yw. With 50% Yg closure and for various land use changes, self-sufficiency ratio will be >1 for rice in 2030 and about one in 2050 but well below one for maize and wheat in both 2030 and 2050. With full Yg closure, self-sufficiency ratios will be well above one for rice and all three cereals jointly but below one for maize and wheat for all scenarios, except for the scenario with drastic decrease in boro rice area to allow for area expansion for cash crops. Full Yg closure of all cereals is needed to compensate for area decreases and demand increases, and then even some maize and large amounts of wheat imports will be required to satisfy demand in future. The results of this analysis have important implications for Bangladesh and other countries with high population growth rate, shrinking arable land due to rapid urbanization, and highly vulnerable to climate change.",2018.0

Water scarcity is an important limitation for grassland production in arid regions. In this study, we carried out comparison experiments to assess the impacts of irrigation schemes on forage yield, water use efficiency, and nutrients in the single and mixed sowing ways of Medicago sativa L. and Agropyron cristatum in different stages in artificial grassland. Results indicated that deficit irrigation can increase forage yields of M. sativa and A. cristatum in most growth stages and sowing treatments. Heavy deficit irrigation or even no irrigation had the greatest potential to increase forage yields of both species in the squaring stage and instantaneous water-use efficiency (WUEI) in all growth stages. They can also significantly increase the nutritional level of M. sativa using a mixed sowing method. In June and September, only irrigating to near field capacity (T1) can increase the long-term water-use efficiency (WUEL) of both species. We suggest irrigating with water to near field capacity in June, and applying deficit irrigation in July and August.

However, such reforms do appear to have an impact on the outcome of subsequent elections, but to varying degrees, based on the factors of macroeconomic stability, institutional development, and a wise sequencing of proposed reforms.

We find that more than half of the platform movies which later went to national release would have earned higher profits if they had been given a wide release.,"Major Hollywood studios typically release new movies in North America in one of the two ways, wide release or platform release. In this paper, we investigate how release form affects the demand of a new movie after it is nationally released. In particular, we focus on movies for which the platform release is pre-planned to make the problem tractable. We estimate our model using a sample of Hollywood movies that eventually received nationwide release from 1999 to 2003. Our results show that platform release shifts consumers’ perception of unobservable movie appeal through its first stage performance, which turns out to be a stronger effect than that of advertising. Meanwhile, we find that the demand for platform movies decays faster than for wide release ones after their national release. Using counterfactual analysis, we find that more than half of the platform movies which later went to national release would have earned higher profits if they had been given a wide release.",2013.0

(1) Disillusionment with the Negro National League collapse, apprehension about the ability of the leagues to complete a season, complications of player trade disputes, and low attendance figures led to a muddled portrait of black baseball in 1932. The black press only fed the disillusionment and apprehension of its readers, aiding what would become a historiographical lapse in coverage of the season. Their initial bias and eventual apathy only added further confusion as they attempted to clarify the championships, legitimacy, and politics of the foundering Negro Leagues. The topography of baseball newspaper reporting in 1932 is herein defined through the analysis and statistical sampling of a set of nineteen black newspapers. Those newspapers are then divided into various regional locations in some instances and circulation coverage areas in others (see table 1). The sample is largely the result of availability. Each of the newspapers listed in table 1 provides either complete or near-complete surviving coverage for the 1932 calendar year. Availability, of course, necessarily omits some publications that would immensely benefit such a study. Nashville, Tennessee, and Monroe, Louisiana, for example, play significant roles in the 1932 season, yet the black newspapers for those cities (the Nashville Globe and Independent and the Southern Broadcast, respectively) no longer survive. (2) Only the Negro Southern League (NSL) completed league play for a full season. The East-West folded before the close of the season's first half. As a consequence, the statistical analysis only treats coverage of the NSL. The categorizations and calculations that follow all stem from the original core list of nineteen newspapers. (3) That core list greeted the 1932 season--particularly the formation of the assumed major league concentrated in the northeast, the East-West Colored Baseball League--with skepticism. As early as July 9, the Baltimore Afro-American reprinted a John L. Clark article originally written for the West Penn Service that insinuated that the league's organizer, Cumberland Posey, was forming the league as a countermeasure to the success of the Pittsburgh Crawfords. (4) Posey's Homestead Grays (a Pittsburgh team) competed for dollars and notoriety with their crosstown rival, and the mogul's attempt to form the league was, for Clark, a direct attempt to omit the competition from league play. His critique went further. Clark charged that ""Washington, Newark, New York, Norfolk, and Kansas City are likely to be excluded. In spite of the fact that Cleveland and Detroit [included teams] had poor gate attractions last year, they will get preference over the five teams just mentioned. They will be preferred because Cum can dictate to them, which fact dovetails with the prime objective."" W. A. Greenlee, owner of the Crawfords, echoed Clark's sentiments in late February. ""You probably know,"" wrote Greenlee in a widely published letter to the press, ""that Posey's interest in a league came after the Crawfords had their first successful playing season."" The criticism seemed valid, as Posey purchased a controlling interest in the East-West Detroit entry and stocked the team with Homestead players.

154421177,The faces of liberal capitalism: Anglo-Saxon banking systems in crisis?,The recent financial crisis has shaken confidence in the conventional wisdom of economic liberalism. The sharply divergent experiences of the four main Anglo-Saxon banking systems suggest that the crisis may not so much be one of liberal capitalism per se as it is of neoclassical variety that characterises the British and American systems.,"The recent financial crisis has severely shaken confidence in the conventional wisdom of economic liberalism, giving rise to debate about the appropriate direction of theory and policy. In this context, the sharply divergent experiences of the four main Anglo-Saxon banking systems suggest that the crisis may not so much be one of liberal capitalism per se as it is of the neoclassical variety that characterises the British and American systems. Whereas these banking systems were very badly affected by the crisis, the Canadian and Australian systems were not. Our analysis suggests that this can be explained by differences in the way that economic liberalism was interpreted and translated into policy in the four countries during the period preceding the crisis. It also suggests that broad classifications of national business systems into 'liberal market' and other varieties of capitalism do not capture their inherent diversity, and that financial market liberalisation does not necessarily lead to instability, particularly when it is accompanied by appropriate supervision and prudential regulation.

Most interventions emphasize institutions and policies rather than the strategies and choices of the rural poor.,Abstract Economists have begun to examine the potential of market and fiscal policy interventions for improving environmental management among small farmers. These approaches can be criticized for failing to reflect both the “demand” and “supply” side of the equation. Most interventions emphasize institutions and policies rather than the strategies and choices of the rural poor. Important moves to improve resource accounting and to remove disincentives to better environmental management will have unpredictable effects if the perspectives of most environmental managers are not considered on the “demand” side of the equation.,1992.0

The heavier taxation of peat has decreased the energy use of peat especially during the latter half of the 1990s.,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes in peat production and taxation of peat in the 1990’s. The study also analyses the potential effects of changes of taxation of peat. The taxation of peat, as well as energy taxation in general, has been continuously increasing. At the same time, subsidies on peat production have in practice been discontinued. The heavier taxation of peat has decreased the energy use of peat especially during the latter half of the 1990’s. Simultaneously, the liberalisation of the electricity markets has decreased the price of electricity, reducing the competitiveness of peat in electricity production. In a ‘wood scenario’, the CO2 component of the energy tax on peat would be decreased to the same level as the tax on wood, whereas in a ‘coal scenario’, the CO2 component would be raised to the level of the tax on coal. The ‘wood scenario’ results in higher peat consumption and lower coal consumption and, to some degree, also lower wood consumption than current taxes. Employment in peat production would be increased only slightly, however. The ‘coal scenario’ would clearly decrease the consumption of peat. Employment in peat production would be decreased by several hundreds of man years. The changes in the structure of energy taxation would not, however, have significant macroeconomic effects. – Peat ; production of electricity ; production of heat ; carbon dioxide tax ; carbon dioxide emissions ; GHG-balance",2000.0

We depart from previous literature by bringing into focus the opportunity cost of technological effort. A firm that spends time in acquiring a more efficient technology delays the commercialization of its products, thus incurring an opportunity cost in terms of profits forgone. Protection increases both the opportunity cost and the benefits from technological effort. In the case of linear demand function and constant returns to scale technology, protection is shown to unambiguously reduce the protected firm's technological effort. Export subsidy is also shown to reduce technological effort when the potential level of exports under free trade is high.",2000.0

Some institutions associated with the organization of labor and capital are robust correlates of investment. Few data support the view that variables related to the organization of the state, including fiscal federalism and political regime-type, affect macroeconomic performance.","Do institutions help explain macroeconomic performance? This article addresses two issues. First, especially given the practical implications of the literature, measurement of institutions should avoid tautologies, and therefore this study uses econometrics to estimate the effect of objectively measurable institutions such as labor market organization, financial development, fiscal federalism, and political regime-type. Second, the growing literature on these promising factors, in turn, is unfortunately incommensurable because previous studies fail to control for other institutional and, in some cases, standard economic variables. Given data on up to ninety-four countries from 1961 through 2000, extreme-bound analysis (EBA), an econometric technique that addresses the sensitivity of previous findings to alternative assumptions about model specification, suggests that some institutions associated with the organization of labor and capital are robust correlates of investment.

The paper outlines a survey conducted in the area of Rennes to analyse consumer behaviour after the BSE crisis. A contingent scenario was proposed to determine the willingness to pay (WTP) for beef which should not transmit CJD using a mix of the referendum method and the bidding process. The variables considered as main determinants of the WTP have been selected.

The survival of Tibetan culture in the Indian diaspora is one of the wondrous events of our time. The survival of Tibetan culture in the Indian diaspora is one of the wondrous and hopeful events of our time.,"Throughout human history there has always been a flow of persecuted and dislocated people. Today, in the age of totalitarianism, that flow has become a flood. In our time, millions have fled from reigns of terror in their homelands seeking refuge and a new life in another society and culture. Most have no other choice but to escape from intolerable threat and danger, to break with the bonds of their heritage and try to become part of a different national tradition, contributing some of their own values to the new country of their choice. For most of them, their past is gone, their life has changed under the pressure of new demands caused by the need for assimilation. In that sense Tibetans who fled to India are not ordinary refugees. They have taken refuge not as individuals alone, but rather as a national polity that has escaped the destruction taking place in Tibet and has sought and been given the protective mantle of a neighboring friendly country. Both a people and cultural institutions have taken refuge in a host setting and have demonstrated both strength and survivability. That is the extraordinary and unique story of the Tibetans in India, a story that demonstrates the vitality of the Tibetan culture and of the people-the one hundred thousand who fled with their leader, the Dalai Lama, from Tibet across the Himalayas to the safety of a land with its own great religious tradition, a land originally the major source of Tibetan Buddhism. India, the land of Gandhi and the land where the Buddha once lived, was the best sanctuary Tibetan polity could have found. Clearly, the survival of Tibetan culture in the Indian diaspora is one of the wondrous and hopeful events of our time.

The majority were linked to the burgeoning working-class movement and were voluntary associations whose members had no other recourse in times of adversity. Hungary was undergoing transformation in the nineteenth century. Changes in goods production and the craft guilds accelerated the establishment of workers’benefit societies, and so did the lack of a coherent system of social insurance in the new industrial order. They grew in tandem with the expansion of Hungary's economy and the return of constitutional government in 1867, and flourished from the 1870s to the decade preceding the First World War. Austria and Germany provided theoretical justifications and practical models. By the 1890s voluntary mutual benefit societies faced increasing competition from the State. As the economy and social structures evolved, successive governments sponsored their own insurance programmes. By the turn of the century, private companies were also offering life and accident insurance and the appeal of mutual benefit societies to both workers and the middle class diminished. Between the two world wars, they continued to serve a substantial segment of the population.",1993.0

The package consists of a system of computer programs written in the BASIC language for a Digital PDP 11/70 time-sharing computer. The framework upon which the package is based is essentially an amalgamation of the System Dynamics and Input-Output approaches to the modelling of complex organizations. Networks of levels and flows provide the basis for dynamic, modular representation, while matrix algebra features provide the basis for aggregational flexibility and the analysis of multi- product multi-process industrial systems. The package is designed to provide planning managers with the ability to construct flexible models, localized or ‘corporate’, financial or non-financial, without the need for any programming in the conventional sense. A flow diagram of the system to be modelled guides the model builder in responding to computer terminal prompts which determine the model structure as a set of programmed relationships. This in turn gives rise to a further series of prompts at the terminal for the entry of all data pertinent to the model. Model editing and computation then proceeds, with user interaction, if desired, for amendments, monitoring of computations, and report generation. Two specific applications of the package are discussed in the latter part of the paper, and sample output from runs of both of the resultant models is provided.",1980.0

The study uses voluntary segment disclosure above the benchmark minimum as a proxy for transparency.,"Weakness of corporate governance and lack of transparency are often considered causes of or contributors to the Asian Financial Crisis. Publicly listed companies in Hong Kong, like other Asian firms, have concentrated director ownership. The study uses voluntary segment disclosure above the benchmark minimum as a proxy for transparency and examines its relationship to the ownership structure and composition of corporate boards in Hong Kong. We find that: (1) high (concentrated) board ownership explains the extent of low voluntary segment disclosure and this negative relationship is stronger when firm performance is very poor; (2) the contribution of non-executive directors to enhance voluntary segment disclosure is effective for firms with low director ownership but not for concentrated-ownership firms. These results have implications for policy makers and regulators in the Asia-Pacific region striving to improve governance and transparency.",2004.0
154426578,Stock Prices and Financial Analysts' Recommendations,The recommendations of a Canadian brokerage house are evaluated by a number of techniques. The results reveal that an investor following the recommendations would have achieved significantly positive abnormal returns.,"The recommendations of a Canadian brokerage house are evaluated by a number of techniques. The results reveal that an investor following the recommendations would have achieved significantly positive abnormal returns, even after allowing for transactions cost. DURING THE RECENT DECADE, considerable evidence has been produced in support of the hypothesis that stock prices reflect all publicly available information. The apparent difficulty of ""picking winners"" has generated a certain skepticism about the economic value of professional investment advice. In 1933 Cowles [8] concluded that several types of investment advice were not of value to investors. Similar conclusions were reached by Colker [5], Diefenback [9], and Logue and Tuttle [15]. Other studies by Cheney [4] and the more recent ones by Lloyd-Davies and Canes [14], Groth, et al., [11], Black [2], Copeland and Mayers [6], and Givoly and Lakonishok [10] provide evidence that brokerage houses and investment advisory services do provide valuable investment advice to their customers. It is interesting that the more recent studies which report positive abnormal performance are more careful in adjusting for risk, and concentrate on returns achieved by customers of the brokerage house/investment adviser, rather than by readers of a more widely disseminated publication (such as the Wall Street Journal). The purpose of this paper is to add to the existing performance measurement literature by evaluating the investment advice of a leading Canadian brokerage house. Although similar in scope, this study differs in several ways from previous studies in this area. First, the brokerage house recommendations involve both Canadian and U.S. stocks; this permits analysis of comparative advantage in information acquisition. Second, the investment recommendations utilized are disseminated to fewer market participants than is the case in previous studies. Finally, the firm produces several types of investment advice, reflecting different expectations about possible abnormal returns.",1983.0

To focus attention it starts with a simple poverty decomposition framework where a change in poverty is shown to be the sum of a change due to economic growth and a change due to income distribution.

This paper shows how some popular measures of spatial concentration relying on areal data can be modified to account for neighboring effects and spatial autocorrelation.,"A common problem with spatial economic concentration measures (e.g. Gini, Herfindhal, entropy and Ellison-Glaeser indices) is accounting for the position of regions in space. While they purport to measure spatial clustering, these statistics are confined to calculations within individual areal units. They are insensitive to the proximity of regions - to neighboring effects. Clearly, economic clusters may cross the boundaries of the regions. Yet with current measures, any industrial agglomeration that traverses boundaries will be chopped into two or more pieces. Activity in adjacent spatial units is treated in exactly the same way as activity in far-flung, non-adjacent areas.

The investor pays for the auditor's penalty through the audit fees and expects to collect a portion of it—when the investor recovers the entire expected penalty, the insurance role is perfect. When the investment is exogenous, consistent with Watts' (2003a, 2003b) argument, we find that an increase in the auditor's insurance role improves audit quality and conservatism, because conservatism helps to reduce the auditor's legal liability. However, when the investment level is endogenous, we find that the investment level and conservatism decrease with increases in the auditor's insurance role, because conservatism helps to mitigate the deadweight loss of the legal liability cost.",2016.0

Cheaper and more informative tests will induce more people to undertake these tests.,"Personalized medicine is still in its infancy, with costly genetic tests providing Little actionable information in terms of e¢ cient prevention decisions. As a consequence, few people undertake these tests currently, and health insurance contracts pool all agents irrespective of their genetic background. Cheaper and especially more informative tests will induce more people to undertake these tests and will impact not only the pricing but also the type of health insurance contracts. We develop a setting with endogenous prevention decisions and we study which contract type (pooling or separating) emerges at equilibrium as a function of the proportion of agents undertaking the genetic test as well as of the informativeness of this test. Our results show that, ceteris paribus, the higher is the proportion of tested agents, the more likely is the emergence of a separating equilibrium that implies some risk discrimination. However, a better pooling contract in which policyholders undertake preventive actions (and lower their health risk) can be attained if the informativeness of the genetic tests increases su¢ ciently. Once the proportion of tested individuals reaches a threshold, we move abruptly from pooling to separating equilibrium, which unambiguously decreases social welfare. Once the equilibrium is of the separating type, social welfare increases with the genetic tests take-up rate, thanks to a composition e¤ect.",2019.0
52376354,Penalty Structures and Deterrence in a Two-Stage Model: Experimental Evidence,Increasing penalty structures for repeat offenses are ubiquitous in penal codes. We test a two-stage theoretical model that predicts decreasing penalty structures will yield greater deterrence than increasing penalty structures. We find that decreasing fine structures are more effective at reducing risky behavior.,"Increasing penalty structures for repeat offenses are ubiquitous in penal codes, despite little empirical or theoretical support. Multi-period models of criminal enforcement based on the standard economic approach of Becker (1968) generally find that the optimal penalty structure is either flat or declining. We experimentally test a two-stage theoretical model that predicts decreasing penalty structures will yield greater deterrence than increasing penalty structures. We find that decreasing fine structures are more effective at reducing risky behavior. Additionally, our econometric analyses reveal a number of behavioral findings. Subjects are deterred by past convictions, even though the probability of detection is independent across decisions. Further, subjects appear to take the two-stage nature of the decision making task into account, suggesting that subjects consider both current and future penalties. Even controlling for the fine a subject faces for any given decision, being in a decreasing fine structure has a significant effect on deterrence.",2015.0
141407145,Cumulative Risks of Multiple Criminal Justice Outcomes in New York City,Most of what happens in the criminal justice system occurs at the level of the misdemeanor rather than the felony. This article addresses our limited understanding of the scope of subfelony justice.,"Previous research has provided estimates of the cumulative risk of felony conviction and imprisonment in the United States. These experiences are, however, also the rarest; most of what happens in the criminal justice system occurs at the level of the misdemeanor rather than the felony. This article addresses our limited understanding of the scope of subfelony justice by providing estimates of the cumulative risk of several lower-level arrest outcomes for one jurisdiction: New York City. Because of excess life table events contributed by nonresidents of New York City, estimates are likely upwardly biased relative to the true values. Nonetheless, they allow us to (1) assess the cumulative risk of misdemeanor conviction and jail sentences and (2) determine to what extent those who enter the world of subfelony justice are distinct from those with felony or imprisonment records.",2019.0
5039192,Role of Instructors' Forum Interactions With Students in Promoting MOOC Continuance,This article describes how MOOCs present both opportunities and challenges to educators and learners. The lack of face-to-face engagement introduces a sense of isolation in students.,"This article describes how MOOCs, being a new global education and technology phenomenon, present both opportunities and challenges to educators and learners. The lack of face-to-face engagement introduces a sense of isolation in students, resulting in a high dropout rate. To this end, online forums are deemed to help overcome the problem by enabling interactions among the learners and facilitating their learning. Recent research further suggests that with an online forum provided in a MOOC, the presence of instructors may not be important. However, in this article, the authors provide two important insights: First, online forum indeed plays an important role in motivating learner continuance. Second, among the different types of forum activities, they find that interaction with instructors emerge as an important factor contributing to more assignment completions in addition to forum posting. The authors' post-hoc analysis also indicates that the importance of instructor presence may be particularly salient in the Eastern vis-A -vis Western culture, which points to future research opportunities.",2018.0

It examines specifically financing the deep-draft dredging of coal ports on the East and/or Gulf Coasts. The study supports those recommending caution in coal port development.,"This article discusses whether U.S. society should invest in large-scale coal port development and examines specifically financing the deep-draft dredging of coal ports on the East and/or Gulf Coasts (Baltimore, Hampton Roads, Mobile, and New Orleans) so that fully loaded, large coal-carrying colliers can export coal to Western Europe. By assuming a society-wide perspective, no costs and benefits are attributed to various parties. Although the multifaceted nature of the coal port issue is acknowledged, the core of this study is a large number of different simulations. Each simulation “optimizes” the United States-Western Europe coal trade for a given demand, ocean transportation cost structure, and cost of capital. This relatively simple model focuses on the key tradeoff: the cost of dredging versus lower ocean transportation costs. The study supports those recommending caution in coal port development. The most striking conclusion is the robustness of two solutions - no dredging or dredge only Hampton Roads - depending on the assumptions. Our conclusions also generally do not support simultaneously dredging all deep-draft options, the concurrent dredging of more than one port, or dredging either of the Gulf ports before the two East Coast ports.",1984.0

Results on removal rates are provided for selected dissolved constituents, nutrients, suspended solids, metals and organic contaminants.","A methodologyis presented for assessing the pollution control performance of an on-stream stormwater pond, and the application of this methodology to a specific facility in Kingston, Ontario, Canada is documented. This assessment is based on constituent mass balances for both baseflow and event conditions. Results on removal rates are provided for selected dissolved constituents, nutrients, suspended solids, metals and organic contaminants. In summary, dissolved constituents exhibit zero removal for baseflow periods and positive removal for events; nutrients and suspended solids exhibit negative removal for baseflow periods and positive removal for events; and metals and organics exhibit positive removal for both baseflow periods and events. Constituent removal appears to be controlled mainly by physical processes (sedimentation), and the uncertainties associated with the estimates of constituent loads are quantified.",1997.0

The literature on targeting concerns itself with the design of tax and transfer programs for poverty alleviation in the presence of limited information on who the poor are. The literature on intrahousehold inequality arose out of a dissatisfaction with""unitary""models of the household, especially in explaining inequality in consumption and achievements of different household members, even after allowing for relevant differences among them. The authors begin to forge the link between the two literatures, so they can address issues policymakers face around the world. After a brief reprise of the key features of the two literatures, they indicate how the presence of intrahousehold inequality and allocation mechanisms could affect the standard analysis of targeting theory.

The paper introduces the concept of an alternative Hybrid Power System that combines photovoltaic modules and digesters fuelled by goat manure as the basis for rural sustainable development.,"Biomasses created from natural resources such as firewood, charcoal and forest crops are still the main source of energy in many communities in the developing countries of the world. The absence of modern techniques, in terms of energy conversion and the lack of resource planning, places a great burden on the environment, not only in terms of deforestation but the polluting residual emissions created by the burning of such fuels. Even in some developed countries, it is possible to find rural areas that have no access to the conventional national electrical grid. The lack of this facility is detrimental to the social and economic development of any country or community. Renewable energy systems have been used in many cases to mitigate these problems. The present paper introduces the concept of an alternative Hybrid Power System configuration that combines photovoltaic modules and digesters fuelled by goat manure as the basis for rural sustainable development. Attention is drawn to the Northeast Region of Brazil, one of the largest semi-arid regions in a single country. The regional conditions of Northeast of Brazil are not unique, suggesting that other countries of a similar nature would benefit from the same energy system.",2010.0

The attempts by the Australian Shipping and Travel Officers' Association (ASTOA) and the Federated Clerks' Union (FCU) to organize the travel agency industry demonstrate the problems faced by unions in moving into such traditionally neglected areas. Despite low membership in the industry, and opposition from both the peak employer organization, the Australian Federation of Travel Agents (AFTA), and the FCU, ASTOA has recently been successful in obtaining a consent award covering a small number of companies.

The energy trade between India and Pakistan has enormous potential to lock them into an irreversible economic interdependence.,"Abstract To date, there has been no confidence-building measure capable of locking India and Pakistan into an irreversible relationship and acting as a powerful catalyst for bilateral development, prosperity and regional stability. In the absence of mutual trust, confidence and cooperation between these two countries, it becomes imperative to identify potential areas of cooperation to reduce threat perceptions in the region. Although the economic relationship alone does not play a pivotal role in strengthening the foundation on which the political relationship is built, it could be argued that economic factors have a considerable leverage in influencing the political relationship. In this regard, a focus on energy trade gains significant attention. The energy trade between India and Pakistan has enormous potential to lock them into an irreversible economic interdependence, thereby reinforcing their efforts to intensify relations in other potential areas of cooperation.

The study utilizes insights from a resource-based view and research on social capital to demonstrate that the environmental performance of a firm is also influenced by the difficult-to-imitate capabilities that are embedded in the network relationships of its directors.,"This paper highlights the importance of a firm's board with respect to sustainability issues by analysing the relationship between director interlocks, i.e. directors who simultaneously belong to the boards of directors of several companies, and a firm's environmental performance. The previous literature has focused on the influence of firm-level resources on corporate environmental performance. This study utilizes insights from a resource-based view and research on social capital to demonstrate that the environmental performance of a firm is also influenced by the difficult-to-imitate capabilities that are embedded in the network relationships of its directors. Our results support a contingency perspective of the social capital theory that finds that director interlocks are positively connected with the environmental performance of a firm in two specific situations: (1) when the firm is linked to a larger parent company and (2) in cases of low and high levels of interlock diversity.

Sports pursuits and music are the most popular and car is the main transport mode to these activities. Families who live in the larger cities have less access to a car than families living in other places.,"Unlike school trips, the leisure activities of children and transport to these activities have received relatively little attention. Organized activities have increased and the immediate neighbourhood is not always the most appropriate or desirable area to play in or carry out various leisure activities. This paper presents findings from a nationwide survey in Norway that focus on children's mobility. The results suggesting that a large proportion of children 6-12 years participate in organized leisure activities - sporting pursuits and music being the most popular and car is the main transport mode to these activities. The car share is higher than for school trips. The analysis indicates that children, particularly in these age groups, have parents with at least one car and who use the car for most purposes. Families who live in the larger cities have less access to a car than families living in other places, and this is reflected in the transport mode when children are escorted to leisure activities. Although distance to activities and children's age are important for car-use, parents travel habits also have an impact on mode choice for these purposes.",2009.0

It identifies a dramatic migration turnaround in the Republic of Ireland as net migration loss was replaced by high levels of net inward migration after 1996. The migration turnaround comprised less outward migration and a strong inflow, including return migrants (first and second generation) and overseas-born non-citizen immigrants.

Examples of chaotic systems in society and the environment are given.,"SUMMARY The paper outlines some main features of chaos theory. Examples of chaotic systems in society and the environment are given. Spontaneous interaction of components, without being planned or directed, is known as ‘self-organising behaviour’. Chaos is an essential aspect of this self organisation, occurring in many forms. A chaotic system is defined as one that shows sensitivity to initial conditions. If the errors relative to the initial conditions become too great, the system will eventually collapse. Development projects are sensitive to such initial conditions. In particular, two examples in development are outlined in some detail and commented upon. One is the occurrence of a project promoting self-organising systems among the poorest of the poor. The other outlines how rehabilitation after resettlement in a power project has transgressed the ‘edge of chaos’ socio-emotionally, in spite of the socioeconomic development being good.",2001.0

Theory does not generally support the prediction that the two policy tools will have the same economic effects.","Abstract In the U.S., existing monetary base measures add an adjustment factor for changes in reserve requirement ratios to high powered money. Implicitly, the monetary base assumes that the economic effects of changes in reserve requirements are identical to those due to changes in high-powered money. Theory, however, does not generally support the prediction that the two policy tools will have the same economic effects. Structural VARs are estimated to compare the short-run paths of inflation and output growth under two different types of policy shocks. In doing so, this analysis gives one a measure of the costs associated with this implicit equivalence assumption. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the Federal Reserve at least partially offsets reserve requirement changes with open market operations and the hypothesis that dynamic explanations of macroeconomic variables are improved by separating reserve requirement changes from other monetary policy moves.",1995.0

We argue that firms headquartered in the financial center have better information environment than other firms. One of the channels via which improvement in information environment takes place is the clustering of firms in the financial center. We believe that, for any given level of resources, it is relatively cost effective for stock market participants to expend their resources on clustered firms to obtain value relevant information than on dispersed firms, thereby improving information environment of firms headquartered in the financial centers relative to other firms. Our arguments claim that better information environment of firms headquartered in the financial centers helps in maintaining investors’ confidence.",2013.0

I employ multilevel modeling to examine how neighborhood minority composition is associated with change in neighborhood relative economic status from 1970 to 2010 in the largest 100 metropolitan areas of the USA. In the multilevel framework, the empirical analysis shows that the shares of black and Hispanic residents are consistently negatively related to neighborhood economic gain even when metropolitan-level factors are taken into account. This study also finds that the negative effect of neighborhood minority composition on neighborhood economic gain is differentiated by deindustrialization and minority composition at the metropolitan level. In the longitudinal framework, the findings show that the negative effect of neighborhood minority composition on neighborhood economic gain has declined over time.",2016.0
153578702,Trade union behaviour and inter-regional variations in unemployment rates,The disparity of unemployment rates across the United Kingdom is much more marked than the corresponding dispersion of wage rates. The price that low-efficiency regions pay for this desire for wage equality is higher unemployment rates.,"An important problem in the political economy of the United Kingdom is that the disparity of unemployment rates across its regions is much more marked than the corresponding dispersion of wage rates. One possibility is that this is due to the attitude of trade unions to their members in different regions. If unions wish to preserve parity between members in different regions, then they will value wage equality between regions over and above wage levels. This may then persuade them to overlook interregional productivity differences in setting wages. The price that low-efficiency regions will then pay for this desire for wage equality is higher unemployment rates. Copyright 1991 by Kluwer Academic Publishers",1991.0
153578994,The Arbitrage Pricing Model and Returns on Assets Under Uncertain Inflation,Authors have derived models in a mean-variance world utilizing methodologies similar to that first utilized by Mossin [9] or Merton. The only risk that cannot be diversified away is the covariance of an asset's return with the market.,"THE IMPACT OF INFLATION on equilibrium returns in capital markets has been the subject of several articles in recent years. Chen and Boness [1], Friend, Landskroner and Losq [4], Long [7] and Roll [13] have all constructed general equilibrium models which incorporate the impact of uncertain inflation on returns.' All of these authors have derived models in a mean-variance world utilizing methodologies similar to that first utilized by Mossin [9] or Merton [8]. The basic underlying tenet of mean-variance analysis is that for any given level of expected return investors wish to minimize the variance of return. In mean-variance equilibrium models the only risk that cannot be diversified away is the covariance of an asset's return with the market return. Assets which have the same covariance with the market have the same equilibrium required return. Thus in a mean-variance world if each member of the following pairs of assets had the same covariance with the market each member would have the same expected return: (a) a stock which was a perfect hedge against inflation versus one which was not, (b) a stock which was a perfect hedge against oil price changes versus one which was not, (c) a security that hedged against interest rate changes versus one which did not. In this article we break out of the limitations of the mean variance assumptions by utilizing the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) of Ross [15], [16], [17]. This",1983.0

The study is to examine the nature and the characteristics of stock market volatility of Kenyan stock markets and its stylized facts using GARCH models. In a financial crisis; the negative returns have higher volatility than positive returns.,"Economic decisions are modeled based on perceived distribution of the random variables in the future, assessment and measurement of the variance which has a significant impact on the future profit or losses of particular portfolio. The ability to accurately measure and predict the stock market volatility has a wide spread implications. Volatility plays a very significant role in many financial decisions. The main purpose of this study is to examine the nature and the characteristics of stock market volatility of Kenyan stock markets and its stylized facts using GARCH models. Symmetric volatility model namly GARCH model was used to estimate volatility of stock returns. GARCH (1, 1) explains volatility of Kenyan stock markets and its stylized facts including volatility clustering, fat tails and mean reverting more satisfactorily.The results indicates the evidence of time varying stock return volatility over the sampled period of time. In conclusion it follows that in a financial crisis; the negative returns shocks have higher volatility than positive returns shocks. Keywords: GARCH, Stylized facts, Volatility clustering",2015.0

The effectiveness of the optimal hedge ratios is examined through the mean returns and the average variance reduction between the hedged and the unhedged positions for 1-, 5-, 10- and 20-day horizons.","In a free capital mobile world with increased volatility, the need for an optimal hedge ratio and its effectiveness is warranted to design a better hedging strategy with future contracts. This study analyses four competing time series econometric models with daily data on NSE Stock Index Futures and S&P CNX Nifty Index. The effectiveness of the optimal hedge ratios is examined through the mean returns and the average variance reduction between the hedged and the unhedged positions for 1-, 5-, 10- and 20-day horizons. The results clearly show that the time-varying hedge ratio derived from the multivariate GARCH model has higher mean return and higher average variance reduction across hedged and unhedged positions. Even though not outperforming the GARCH model, the simple OLS-based strategy performs well at shorter time horizons. The potential use of this multivariate GARCH model cannot be sublined because of its estimation complexities. However, from a cost of computation point of view, one can equally consider the simple OLS strategy that performs well at the shorter time horizons.",2008.0

Three independent variables are suggested: neighbourhood effect, campaign spending, constituency type.","Abstract The study of short-term electoral change at a fine spatial scale is frequently hampered by the unavailability of suitable ecological data, let alone data on individuals. In Britain, most studies of change have used the measure of swing. An alternative is presented here, using national survey data to predict short-term electoral change in each English constituency. The deviations between the observed and predicted values are the dependent variables in an analysis of the ecological determinants of short-term change. Three independent variables are suggested: the neighbourhood effect; campaign spending; and constituency type (reflecting the spatial division of labour). All three contribute substantially in regression analyses, although some of the coefficients relating to campaign spending are difficult to interpret.",1981.0

Most alleged costs to the US economy from inward FDI are either unlikely to occur or are already anticipated by existing US laws.,"The growth of outward investment from China has generated expressions of concern from policymakers in the United States regarding the economic and national security impacts of such investments. While inward foreign direct investment (FDI) has come to be viewed by most observers as generally imparting net economic benefits to the host economy, acquisitions of US companies by Chinese multinational companies (MNCs) have been criticized on several grounds. One is based on the mode of entry itself: some critics believe that entry by acquisition brings lower benefits than greenfield entry. A second and more prominent concern is that acquisitions of US companies by Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) may be motivated by non-commercial objectives which, in turn, make those acquisitions of questionable value to the host economy. In this paper, we argue that Chinese FDI in the United States is more likely to take the form of acquisitions than greenfield investments for the foreseeable future. However, there is no strong case to be made that the host country economic benefits from Chinese FDI would be larger if entry took place primarily through greenfield investments. Furthermore, most of the alleged costs to the US economy from inward FDI from China are either unlikely to occur or are already anticipated by existing US laws and regulations, thus necessitating no additional, specific legislation.",2009.0

The property rights structure, led by state-owned banks, is the prominent feature of the Chinese banking system. China’s financial decision-making authority belongs to the State Council.","Based on a systematic review and summarization of China’s 30 years of financial reform and development, this paper comprehensively analyzes the past, present and future development of China’s financial system and also presents the mechanism for China’s financial development from the view of political economics. Generally, the Chinese financial system is bank-oriented. The property rights structure, led by state-owned banks, is the prominent feature of the Chinese banking system. Equity, bond, money, currency and real estate markets have been developing rapidly; however, the development rate of these markets varies, and institutional construction generally falls behind the market development. China’s financial decision-making authority belongs to the State Council, and the financial supervision system adopts the mode of “separate regulation.” China’s state-driven, progressive financial reforms have promoted the formation of the government-led financial structure, which is composed of three parts: first, monetary policy, balancing both inflation control and economic growth; second, bank credit expansion under the implicit guarantee of the state; and third, the adjustable pegged exchange rate system based on capital controls. The next phase of financial reform in China will mainly focus on the following four key goals: first, to further improve the corporate governance and the mixed operation of financial institutions; second, to construct the institution of a financial market system and improve the effectiveness of the financial markets; third, to re-integrate regulatory resources, combine macro- and micro-prudent views, and establish a comprehensive framework for financial stability; fourth, to promote the liberalization of interest rates, marketization of the exchange rate and the opening of capital accounts based on a progressive approach and to improve the openness of the financial system based on macroeconomic stability.",2011.0

A partial market equilibrium model is used to analyze an energy demand scenario in which wood use increases 400 million cubic meters in the United States for ethanol production. A key finding is that if wood use for biofuels increases to high levels and mill residue is used for biofuels, then the increased greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas could offset reductions obtained by substituting biofuels for gasoline.","Consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) has emerged as a tool for estimating environmental impacts of changes in product systems that go beyond physical relationships accounted for in attributional LCA (ALCA). This study builds on recent efforts to use more complex economic models for policy‐based CLCA. A partial market equilibrium (PME) model, called the U.S. Forest Products Module (USFPM), is combined with LCA to analyze an energy demand scenario in which wood use increases 400 million cubic meters in the United States for ethanol production. Several types of indirect economic and environmental impacts are identified and estimated using USFPM‐LCA. A key finding is that if wood use for biofuels increases to high levels and mill residue is used for biofuels and replaced by natural gas for heat and power in forest products mills, then the increased greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas could offset reductions obtained by substituting biofuels for gasoline. Such high levels of biofuel demand, however, appear to have relatively low environmental impacts across related forest product sectors.",2012.0

We identify three distinct episodes and document shifts in dividend policies in the 1930s and 1980s, because firm managers cater to the changing preferences of shareholders. The first episode, prior to World War II, was characterised by dividends that were fixed contracts between shareholder and management and the payouts were mechanically determined by earnings. The second epoch of Dutch dividend policy, until the 1980s, was characterised by dividend smoothing. Dividends were still strongly related to earnings, but because of shareholder's preferences for stable dividend income, earnings changes are incorporated in dividends with a lag. Finally, dividend policy in the most recent episode is inspired by shareholder wealth maximisation, based on agency and signalling motives. In this period, dividends have become largely decoupled from earnings.",2019.0

That is, others' violations of moral rules may make it permissible for one to also violate these rules, to avoid being unfairly disadvantaged. This claim, originally advanced by Hobbes, is applied to three cases in business. It is suggested that the claim is one source of scepticism concerning business ethics.

Hence, the observation that two wrongs may make a right does not give people a broad warrant for ignoring moral standards in their business activities.",1983.0

It proposes that acceptable levels of domestic involvement depend on the gravity of the domestic opportunity costs of foreign involvement.,"This article examines and tests two models of the circumstances shaping the extent of the American public&;apos;s isolationist sentiment. The first, termed the “elastic band” model, assumes a constant popular disinclination toward foreign involvements, one that may, at most, temporarily be stretched to accommodate responses to major external threats. A second model assumes the operation of a “cognitive shortcut” based on low-information rationality. It proposes that acceptable levels of domestic involvement depend on the gravity of the domestic opportunity costs of foreign involvement, and it is termed the “domestic costs” model. While the former model implies a constant public resistance to international activism, a resistance that is relaxed only in proportion to the gravity of external threats, the latter model suggests that the U.S. public displays a relatively constant internationalist attitude, and that variations around that threat are largely explained by fluctuations in the perceived domestic opportunity costs of international involvement. ::: ::: Both models are subjected to statistical testing, a testing that vindicates the domestic costs model. Further insights are obtained by examining attitudes toward internationalism as they are affected by levels of education. Although internationalism increases with education, and although levels of education predict differential impacts of the variables encompassed by the model, each segment of the public seems to operate within the general parameters of the “domestic costs” model.",1997.0

Utility continues to be presented in neoclassicism, directly or by implication, as the inclusive and applicable criterion of judgment in the making of decisions concerning all aspects of the production and distribution of real income. Utility, in this context, is the ability of goods and services to generate satisfaction for participants in the creation and exchange of goods.

155863456,The Revival of Monetary Policy,The growth of the public debt during World War II has created a great new potential for monetary control. The process of discovery has been piecemeal; no one has produced a comprehensive formulation of the emerging possibilities.,"mHE enormous growth of the public debt during World War II has been widely interpreted as a crippling restraint upon monetary policy. It has taken the exposure and experience of several years to demonstrate that this debt has, in fact, created a great new potential for monetary control. Although that potential has not yet been extensively utilized, the issues that have been raised as a limited application of the new power has been attempted are already coming under the scrutiny of scholarly analysis and of Congressional investigation. The process of discovery has, of course, been piecemeal; no one has yet produced a comprehensive formulation of the emerging possibilities; and in many quarters there has not yet been any real recognition or understanding of what has come about. Each of the three publications reviewed in the present paper deals with important segments of the new monetary doctrine that is slowly coalescing from the controversies aroused by Federal Reserve System policy over the past several years. Dr. Goldenweiser, uniquely suited for his task by more than a quarter century of participation in monetary policy formation at the highest levels, combines in very short space a clear, elementary, description of Federal Reserve functions, a succinct critical review of the principal actions taken by the System since its founding, and an outline of the measures he considers necessary to make adequate use of monetary control in its present environment.' Professor Bach's book, based largely upon his work for the Hoover Commission on governmental reorganization, is concerned more with the methods than with the substance of Federal Reserve policy-making.2 Although Bach sees less clearly than the others the new opportunities for monetary control, his description of System procedures fills a long-felt need, and his provocative suggestions for strengthening the control apparatus (while not altogether acceptable in the judgment of this reviewer) acquire added significance as the stature of monetary policy is enlarged. The Report of the Subcommittee on Monetary, Credit, and Fiscal Policies, prepared under the chairmanship of Senator Paul Douglas (and referred to henceforth in this review as the Douglas Report), represents the most penetrating Congressional investigation into monetary and banking questions that has been made since the founding of the Federal Reserve System.3 Taken with its two supporting documents, a digest of replies to questionnaires and a volume of hearings, the Douglas Report provides a range of new materials on both the mechanics and the substance of monetary control that could not possibly be catalogued in the space available here. Ignoring the valuable descriptive sections in the Bach and Goldenweiser books,4 as well as those contained in the Douglas Subcommittee documents, the present paper will be devoted to the principal issues for policy and organization that emerge from them. On the substantive side there are three key questions: (I) why is effective control over the money supply and the availability of credit necessary; (2) how is effectiveness in monetary and credit control to be achieved; and (3) what guides or criteria should determine the timing and direction of policy actions? Three further questions arise in considering the details of technique and administration: (4) what tools are needed, both general and selective, to implement the over-all requirements for effectiveness in monetary control; (5) how should the Federal Reserve System be organized internally to achieve the highest level of performance in policy-making and in administration; and (6) how should Federal Reserve policy be coordinated externally with the activities of other credit agencies, and with the broad economic program of the governmental administration?

The links between trade balance and total exports with national income in general as well as the relationship between agricultural exports and manufacturing exports with national income in particular has been examined. To evaluate whether there is statistically significant structural change in the relationship of exports and national income during distinguished policy regimes i.e. open economy and closed economy, the chow test is done for the 2 periods 1970- 1977 and 1978-2002. The relationship between agricultural exports and national income shows a poor relationship due to the declining contribution of agricultural exports to the total exports of the country. However, very good relationship between industrial exports and national income has been discovered from the study. This may be due to the industrial policies of the government, which was aimed at export-oriented industries in an open economy. The study reveals that the country's exports, backed by favourable trade policies have an impact on the economic development of the country. However the results of the chow test indicates that no structural change has taken place in the relationship of exports and national income as a result of changes after the economic liberalization in 1977. The study also highlights the importance of integrating country's trade policy with its industrial and agricultural competent policies, which would make the domestic firms competence enough to face the increased competition in the international market.

In contrast to the finance studies, this research typically models the structure of the economy's demand and supply functions and solves for equilibrium prices by imposing rational expectations. Finally, research in international economics evaluates the impact of alternative monetary transmission mechanisms (e.g., exchange rate policies) upon aggregate economic activity. Although these research topics seem to be highly related, the various literatures are almost totally isolated from each other.",1983.0

This opens up the possibility central banks are pursuing a strategy more akin to a Taylor Rule. In Uganda, these errors are much smaller than South Africa’s, the continent’s sole long-term inflation targeter.","Many low-income countries do not use interest rates as their main monetary policy instrument. In East Africa, for instance, targeting money aggregates has been pretty much the rule rather than the exception. Nevertheless, these targets are seldom met and often readjusted according to the economic environment. This opens up the possibility that central banks are de facto pursuing a strategy more akin to a Taylor Rule. Estimations of small-scale models for Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania suggest that these self-styled ""monetary targeters"" are respecting the Taylor Principle, that is are on average increasing nominal interest rates more than proportionally to inflation. Nevertheless, steep deviations from the Taylor Rule have taken place in Kenya and Tanzania. In Uganda, these errors are much smaller, in fact similar in size to Taylor Rule deviations found for Brazil. More surprisingly, they are smaller than South Africa’s, the continent’s sole long-term inflation targeter.",2015.0

We find that postcommunist countries whose reform strategies minimize increases in inequality have more institutionalized party systems.","Patterns of party system institutionalization have varied widely across regions. In this paper we examine the problem of weak institutionalization in postcommunist democracies along three dimensions: volatility of representation, party extinction, and incumbency disadvantage. Counterintuitively, we see high levels of all three despite sustained economic growth. We consider whether the conventions of economic voting do not apply to postcommunist countries and argue rather that the effects of economic restructuring are critical to understanding electoral outcomes in these cases. Based on a sample of democratic elections from 1990 to 2006 we find that postcommunist countries whose reform strategies minimize increases in inequality have more institutionalized party systems.",2011.0

155868390,"Macroeconomic Stability, Financial Risks and Market Eciency: Evidence for a Small and Open Economy",We find that the dynamics of local financial risks is associated with the evolution of the overall economic conditions of the country. The ability of domestic stock prices to reflect fundamentals information improves during times of stable external conditions.,"We analyze whether changes in external macroeconomic conditions are associated with changes in the dynamics of risk and changes in the degree of informativeness of the price system for the Chilean economy. By focusing our analysis in Chile, we hope to isolate the effect of external macroeconomic volatility from the effects that weak institutions or a poor rule of law might have over domestic markets performance. We find that the dynamics of local financial risks is associated with the evolution of the overall economic conditions of the country, with a strong reduction in idiosyncratic and systematic risks during periods of stable macroeconomic conditions. Since the level and composition of financial risks can affect the net benefits of acquiring and trading on private information, we conjecture that external economic conditions can also affect the informativeness of domestic stock prices. We find that the ability of domestic stock prices to reflect fundamentals information improves during times of stable external conditions. In spite of this, we provide evidence that traditional measures of informationally market efficiency in the R2 literature fail to detect such changes and attempt to explain the reason behind the inability of these measures to properly proxy for stock price informativeness.",2013.0

The study focuses on three main goals. First, we identify and compare the phases and the main features of the female and male immigrant employment cycles and the business cycle by means of their turning points. This target also includes the analysis of the differences in the cyclical pattern between immigrants’ and natives’ employment. Second, we wonder to what extent the global financial crisis initiated in the middle of 2007 modified the cyclical fluctuations of immigrants’ employment and whether female and male employment presents significant differences. Finally, we study whether immigrants’ origin plays some role in employment fluctuations during the pre- and crisis periods. We find that in the Spanish economic upturns, the labour market is more prone to create immigrant males’ employment than females’, while in the downturns females’ employment shows more resilience. With regard to the natives, immigrants remain unemployed longer in downturns and are laid off before the economy reaches its peak. However, a stronger gain of immigrants’ employment appears to be present in periods of expansion and a weaker loss in periods of contraction. In the contraction periods, immigrant females present the highest chances of keeping their employment.",2018.0

Their sample consists of approximately 60,000 observations of foreign-owned MNCs from the years 2005-2009.","This paper investigates profit-shifting behaviour among multinational corporations (MNCs) in China. The authors exploit the flat-rate structure of China's corporate income tax, along with its system of targeted, preferential rates, to estimate the relationship between profits and tax rates. Their sample consists of approximately 60,000 observations of foreign-owned MNCs from the years 2005-2009. Using the traditional approach of regressing before-tax profits on tax rates, the authors find evidence consistent with profit-shifting. However, this approach is suspect because the nature of China's tax preferences makes it especially vulnerable to omitted variable bias. Accordingly, the authors employ finite mixture modelling to search for the existence of a group of profit-shifting MNCs. While their analysis identifies two types of firms, subsequent investigation failed to produce any evidence linking these to profit-shifting behavior. Robustness checks exploiting the panel nature of the dataset, along with further investigation of investment-tax elasticities, confirm the authors' null finding of profit-shifting. One reason for the lack of profit-shifting among Chinese MNCs may be that corporate tax rates were relatively low during this period.",2018.0

The insights for this study extend the theoretical frameworks of strategic learning to the context of market pioneers.,"Abstract Pioneering digital firms are often built on novel business models that differentiate them from their competition. Striving for the right business model is a challenge for entrepreneurs. In their digital endeavors, firms often experiment with multiple business models before converging on to a specific, focused model that they choose to pursue. An intriguing question in this domain is how do digital market pioneers gain strategic knowledge for the transformation of their business models? We develop an integrative framework that identifies strategic learning and its impact on the digital model adopted by the firm, as a core driver for business model transformation. We examine this framework through a case study of Wishberry, a crowdfunding startup in India that was the pioneer in this domain in India. Its active scanning of the business environment led to strategic learnings that helped transform its business model which was at the core of its sustained market advantages. The insights for this study, which are primarily focused on digital entrepreneurship, extend the theoretical frameworks of strategic learning to the context of market pioneers. The learnings from this study will help entrepreneurs design agile business models that are reactive to market needs.",2019.0

156783812,"No Representation without Taxation? Rents, Development, and Democracy",Studies of rentier states argue that democracy is unlikely or even impossible without taxation. Skeptics argue that the lack of democracy in the Middle East and elsewhere can be traced to other factors.,"Natural resource windfalls would seem to be a boon for poor countries. They reduce the burden of taxation, create a middle class, and pay for social services. In the view of most scholars, however, natural resource bounties are more a curse than a bless ing. Studies of rentier states argue that democracy is unlikely or even impossible without taxation, which had a crucial role in the emergence of representation and democracy in European history. Skeptics, however, argue that the negative effects are exaggerated and that the lack of democracy in the Middle East and elsewhere can be traced to other factors. This debate is important because many natural resource exporters are found in the developing world. And the theory speaks directly to a pressing issue: why is the Middle East so resistant to democratization. While the effects of natural resource wealth on democracy has been the subject of much discussion, only recently has Michael Ross, in a pathbreaking and long over due contribution, tested the thesis using a large-n, cross-regional dataset. Ross finds that ""the oil-impedes-democracy claim is both valid and statistically robust, ... oil does hurt democracy."" This conclusion helps to ""vindicate"" the rentier state theory.1 This article revisits this issue and comes to a more ambivalent conclusion. The results differ, first, because a new dataset that directly measures rentierism is used. Second, different methods are used to analyze the data. Third, a different tack is taken in dealing with a phenomenon little discussed in studies of natural resources and democracy: in richer rentier states, rents create a larger middle class, pay for schoolteachers, increase per capita GDP, and drive up other measures of develop ment. As Lipset observed, development is correlated with democracy. But it is far from clear that rent-induced development has a positive effect on democracy, what magnitude it might be, and to what degree it is counterbalanced by the negative con sequences of rentierism. The issue has received scant attention in studies of the ren tier state (though it is engaged in Ross's article and in a study of Congo by John Clark).2 The issue is important not only in analysis of the causal mechanisms under lying the rentier state theory, but also in a multivariate test of the theory, where dif ferent ways of dealing with this issue have an important impact on the results.",2005.0

For five years, from 1919 to 1924, the Comintern represented a genuinely co-operative effort by all Communist Parties to achieve a world revolution they believed to be imminent.","WHEN on October 5, 1947, nine European Communist Parties announced their decision to set up an Information Bureau in Belgrade, popular opinion generally interpreted the step as a revival of the Communist International which had been formally disbanded on May 15, 1943, and the convenience of having a single word, Cominform, to apply to all the manifestations of world Communism has since encouraged faulty analysis of current events on a scale which, taken alone, would justify the establishment of the Cominform as a move in psychological warfare. An accurate evaluation of the Cominform demands knowledge of the evolution of world Communism over thirty years, and of the character and organization of a modern Communist Party. The First and Second Internationals existed to co-ordinate by free discussion the attitude of socialist groups in every country towards all major political issues-on the assumption that these issues were essentially similar for every party. The same general aim inspired the foundation of the Third or Communist International though Lenin, disgusted with the disintegration of the Second International under the strain of war, insisted on an effective discipline to ensure common action. For five years, from 1919 to 1924, the Comintern represented a genuinely co-operative effort by all Communist Parties to achieve a world revolution they believed to be imminent. During this period the Russian Communist Party exercised a dominant but not an exclusive influence. Indeed, in 1922 the Comintern attempted to bargain with the Second International by promising concessions in Soviet policy towards Georgia and towards the Social Revolutionaries in ERussia. Though Soviet influence was usually decisive, the outstanding leaders of the Russian Communist Party were too occupied with their own domestic problems to spare time for the Comintern, where the Soviet representatives were inferior both in status and ability. The record of these first five years was of continual failure. Both the Comintern centre itself and the various national Communist Parties were obsessed by a rigid dogmatism. In particular, the attempt of the Western parties to copy the pattern which had proved successful in Russia was disastrous; they failed completely to understand nationalism and the peasant problem. Real opportunities for revolution in Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria and Poland were mishandled with catastrophic results, and the two largest parties outside Russia which had adhered to the Comintern, the Socialist Parties of Italy and Norway, were deliberately forced out again by a narrow sectarianism. For the next five years, until 1929, as the Soviet State grew in power, the Comintern was increasingly drawn into the factional struggles through",1948.0

We address specific auction design choices by theoretically and experimentally determining optimal information disclosure along two dimensions. Bidders are either informed of the number of bidders in the auction, or know that it is one of two possible sizes; they also either know the number of units remaining for sale or are unaware of how many units have been taken by other bidders. We find that revealing group size decreases bids, and therefore revenue, if units remaining are not shown. When group size is unknown the price also falls if the number of units remaining is revealed. The most efficient and largest revenue outcome occurs when bidders are not provided information on either group size or units remaining.

The paper sheds light on what happens to IC measurement projects when the magnitude of barriers are not so significant as to lead to the complete failure of the project.,"The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the Intellectual Capital Accounting (ICA) literature by investigating the barriers to IC measurement and how they can (re)shape IC measurement projects. The paper presents an interventionist case study of a company which has been measuring its IC for several years. It focuses on some emblematic situations in which barriers arose during the design and implementation of IC indicators followed by a (re)moulding of the IC measurement project within the organization. The case analysis revealed two barriers: the heavy workload that the design and calculation process of IC indicators entails and the perceived limited reliability of those indicators. These barriers did not lead to a complete failure of the project, but acted as a “filter”, resulting in the discontinued use of those indicators that were not perceived as useful or reliable and in the adoption of those that the managers actually considered useful. While this hindered a complete implementation of the ICMS, it promoted a selection of IC indicators and a legitimation of those that subsequently became part of the management control system. While previous studies explore how barriers can hamper the design as well as the implementation of an ICMS, this paper sheds light on what happens to IC measurement projects when the magnitude of barriers is not so significant as to lead to the complete failure of the project. This offers a new and different view of the barriers related to the adoption of ICMSs. Rather than considering them as factors which can interrupt IC measurement, they could be seen as factors which can challenge the implementation of the ICMS, strengthening those IC indicators that are perceived as reliable and useful and eliminating or disregarding those that did not meet expectations.",2019.0

This visual and understandable tool for strategic planning is widely used around the world, but in Ukraine it has not become quite popular, including due to the lack of regulatory and methodological support. This article was an attempt to change this negative trend, as it proves the feasibility of roadmapping use in the planning of sustainable development of amalgamated territorial communities and offers a unified procedure for the construction of such a road map in accordance with the existing legal framework. Attention is focused on the fact that the use of any from these methods of prediction in the amalgamated territorial communities at this stage of decentralization is associated with a significant number of problems.To improve the quality of community planning and overcome the shortage of skilled and professional staff was suggested to use the roadmapping as a process of building a kind of guide-guide or step-by-step scenario of ATС development with reflection in the graph form of strategically important events in the time sequence is proposed.

It also aims to identify the main restrictions to design evidence-based policy. The average woman in the region works 25 h more per month than the average man. Yet only half of women in the region are paid for or otherwise profit from their work. Work without formal pay leads to weak protection of human rights and limits civic participation. Moreover, gender inequality deters economic development and fosters income inequality. Research shows gender gaps result from the interactions of social norms and biological differences. The challenges to generating effective policies include the difficulty of identifying relevant mechanisms to explain gaps, the cost of collecting and analyzing relevant data, and the complexity associated with determining pertinent features of gender gaps. Collection and analysis of those mechanisms, data, and features are critical to learning how to correct gender gaps going forward.",2019.0

There does exist a segment of the labour force with specific risks (low education, foreign origin, female) to become and stay unemployed.","The increase in unemployment to relatively high levels for Switzerland in the 1990s gave rise to two fears: First, that economic growth no longer has any effect on employment (""jobless growth""), and second, that the ""equilibrium"" rate of unemployment, i.e. the rate of employment that prevails even in favourable economic conditions, is on an increasing trend. This paper gives an overview of developments on the Swiss labour market since 1980 in order to shed some light on these mentioned anxieties. As far as the relationship between the growth of GDP and employment is concerned, the conclusion is, that it remains fairly strong. However, labour productivity seems to be increasing more rapidly since the beginning of the 1990s, so that the growth of real GDP must be more than 1.8% to bring about an increase in employment. Quantitative estimates of the ""equilibrium"" rate of unemployment exhibit a large spread and tend to follow actual rates. Our judgement is, that its increase over time is not very pronounced, and the present value lies in the range of 1.5% to 2%.

DuMouchel (1999) used Bayesian data mining to work with large frequency tables with millions of cells for FDA Spontaneous application. Mostafa (2010) also shows many literatures in financial forecasting applications of NNs to predict indexes.,"INTRODUCTION Business Intelligence, such as data mining applications, has made some significant contribution to forecasting science. Burstein and Holsapple (2008) state that ""business intelligence (BI) is a data-driven decision support system that combines data gathering, data storage, and knowledge management with analysis to provide input to the business decision process."" According to Han and Kamber (2006), ""data mining is extracting knowledge from large amounts of data"". Neural Network is one of these data mining applications and useful in making complex predictions in many disciplines. There are many examples of successful data mining being applied. DuMouchel (1999) used Bayesian data mining to work with large frequency tables with millions of cells for FDA Spontaneous application. Giudici (2001) used Bayesian data mining for benchmarking and credit scoring in highly dimensional complex datasets. Jeong, et.al. (2008) integrated data mining with a process designed using the robust Bayesian approach. ""Mostafa (2010) reported many other applications such as air pollution forecasting (e.g. Videnova, Nedialkova, Dimitrova, & Popova, 2006), maritime traffic forecasting (Mostafa, 2004), airline passenger traffic forecasting (Nam & Yi, 1997), railway traffic forecasting (Zhuo, Li-Min, Yong, & Yan-hui, 2007), commodity prices (Kohzadi, Boyd, Kemlanshahi, & Kaastra, 1996), ozone level (Ruiz-Suarez, Mayora-Ibarra, Torres-Jimenez & Ruiz-Suarez, 1995), student grade point averages (Gorr, Nagin & Szczypula, 1994), forecasting macroeconomic data (Aminian, Suarez, Aminian & Walz, 2006), financial time series forecasting (Yu, Wang & Lai, 2009), advertising (Poh, Yao & Jasic, 1998), and market trends (Aiken & Bsat, 1999)."" Mostafa (2010) also shows many literatures in financial forecasting applications of NNs to predict indexes. Started with Cao, Leggio, and Schniederjans (2005) who used NNs to predict stock price movements for firms traded on the Shanghai stock exchange and found that NN models outperform the linear models. Kryzanowski, Galler, and Wright (1993) used NN models with historic accounting and macroeconomic data to identify stocks that will outperform the market. McGrath (2002) used market to book and price earnings ratios in a NN model to rank stocks based on the likelihood estimates. Ferson and Harvey (1993) and Kimoto, Asakawa, Yoda, and Takeoka (1990) used a series of macroeconomic variables to capture predictable variation in stock price returns. McNelis (1996) used the Chilean stock market to predict returns in the Brazilian markets. Yumlu, Gurgen, and Okay (2005) used various NN architectures to model the performance of Istanbul stock exchange over the period 1990-2002. Leigh, Hightower, and Modani (2005) used NN models and linear regression models to model the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index data for the period from 1981 to 1999. Results were robust and informative as to the role of trading volume in the stock market. From this literature survey we find that no previous studies have attempted to predict the changes in stock prices from various industries with comprehensive independent variables. In this study, we want to focus on the 37 stock prices' changes from eight industries by incorporating critical independent variables. If the market is efficient, according to the efficient market hypothesis by Fama, then we cannot predict stocks' prices. Fama (1970, p. 383) defined efficient market hypothesis (EMH) as the idea where ""a market in which prices provide accurate signals for resource allocation, that is, a market in which firms can make production-investment decisions, and investors can choose among the securities that represent ownership of firms' activities under the assumption that security prices at any time 'fully reflect' all available information."" Accordingly, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to consistently predict and outperform the market because the information that one would use to make such predictions would already be reflected in the prices. …",2012.0

The paper includes a series of correlations between the accounting law and the mixed legal institutions. It takes into consideration the relation between the accounting law and the labor law, currency law, competition law, unemployment insurance law, commercial law. As far as the accounting law takes into account the specialized specific needs, the business' informational system will be better connected to their development needs. The paper includes the following chapters: introduction, the relation between the accounting law, labor law and currency law under the expansion of international cooperation of companies, the relation between the accounting law, competition law and labor law to protect firms against unfair competition conditions of their employees, the relation between the accounting law, unemployment insurance law and labor laws in order to achieve flexible relations based on the economic situation, the relations between the accounting law, labor law and tax law to encourage new forms of employer - employee collaboration.Keywords: accounting law, labor law, currency law, competition law, tax law1. IntroductionThe paper fits within the complex interdisciplinary field of study. First of all, the article contains interdisciplinarity between economics and law. Accounting issues are addressed from the perspective of the accounting law legal system that gives legal form to accounting information circuits. Secondly, there is interdisciplinarity between the areas of study: labor law, currency law, competition law, unemployment insurance law, tax law and accounting law.The accounting law was first defined in the doctrine of French accounting and was later adopted by the continental accounting system. The first work which initiated the study of accounting law in Romania took place in 1998. The paper is a novelty because the accounting law in Romania has not reached the phase to be addressed in an interdisciplinary manner in this short period of time, in relation to other branches of law. The existence in the international literature of similar approaches may be relevant because the laws are national par excellence, even with the community harmonization in the European Union.2. The relation between the accounting law, labor law and currency law under the expansion of international cooperation of companiesThe development requires an expansion of international cooperation between firms in different forms. Globalization is the keyword of the current stage of evolution of international economic interdependence. The institution of delegation abroad will be more frequent in the contractual relationship of economic agents with the expansion of the globalization process. For the personnel sent abroad there may occur items related with: currency of payment, payment method, other specific services. The Labor Code establishes that they are separately stated from the beginning of the employment contract. The possible currency risk will become part of the wage costs for the entity which sent staff abroad. The accounting law norm will have ancillary character to these joint institutions.In principle, the displacement in member countries of the OECD involves calculating the income from employment (wages and related expenses) or the daily fees in the currency of the country in which to travel. The payment is also in the same currency. The element subject to negotiation is the level of such payments. In this the question of an interference with the tax law arises. The employment relations necessarily take into account the relationship between services rendered by the employee (the degree to which it is useful to the employer) and the total cost that these services require. More specifically in terms of business, the alteration of the net profit is more important in the contract of employment benefit. The accounting information system must provide the information needed to calculate the net profit implication that different parts of the wage or salary package has. …",2012.0

The essay discusses two branches the economics literature. The first branch, on competitive federalism, stems from Tiebout's 1956 article. It focuses on the horizontal structure of federalism and examines jurisdictional competition between state governments for mobile individuals and resources. The second branch of the literature, on fiscal federalism, examines the vertical structure of federalism, or the division of public services and taxing power between the central and state governments. The essay also examines applications of the economic analysis of federalism to specific areas of the law, including corporate law, antitrust law, environmental law, choice of law rules, contractual choice of law, and public choice theory.",2006.0

In a second deal, IMEC will work with the Flanders Interuniversity Institute of Biotechnology (VIB) and the Catholic University of Leuven to create a Neuro-electronics Convergence Laboratory.","A European collaborative research organization has developed partnerships with two other collaborative research organizations in a bid to extend the frontier of its work. The move shows how even collaborative organizations are now seeking partners outside their own fields in order to move their disciplines forward. In one deal IMEC, the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre, based in Leuven in Belgium's Flanders region will work with the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) on wireless sensors and thin-film electronics. In a second deal, IMEC will work with the Flanders Interuniversity Institute of Biotechnology (VIB) and the Catholic University of Leuven to create a Neuro-electronics Convergence Laboratory to develop neuro-electronic systems. Both collaborations will draw on IMEC's well-established intellectual property strategy. Much of IMEC's pre-competitive work is structured as industrial affiliation programs, in which several industrial partners share a program's results. Individual companies can then form partnerships with IMEC to develop these results into a more specific technology, which is transferred exclusively to them. IMEC will also license technology where appropriate. Track Record of Collaborative Research IMEC has a 21-year track record of collaborative research with industrial and university partners. It was started by the government of Flanders to be the hub of a regional center of excellence in semiconductor research and now gets around 82 percent of its annual 200 million [euro] ($240 million) funding from commercial partners. The IMEC has a staff of 1,390, including those seconded from partner organizations, of which there are around 500 across all its programs. Eight of the world's top ten semiconductor companies are working with the Centre in pre-competitive research programs on future manufacturing processes. TNO is an independent research organization with links to Dutch government ministries. It receives government funding to develop strategic technologies, and acts as a principal laboratory and research institute for some of the ministries. The organization also acts as a holding company for technology spin-outs. TNO received funding of 555 million [euro] in 2004, of which 194 million [euro] came from the government. It has almost 5,000 staff, of which it estimates that around 3,500 are scientists or engineers. Holst Centre Is Formed The deal between IMEC and TNO will form an organization called the Holst Centre, which will work on two technologies they have in common. The first is self-powered, radio-linked sensing systems known as ""wireless autonomous sensors."" An IMEC team is already working on one example of this technology, combining very-low-power radios, electronics and sensors with micropower generation to produce a wireless EEG system in a volume of one cubic centimeter. The second technology the Holst Centre will work on is thin-film electronics, dubbed ""systems in foil."" The vision is that such systems could be used to make large-scale sensing and actuating surfaces, such as active shop windows, or sports arenas whose lines are configured electronically and that can sense a player's actions as part of a system to provide feedback about their play. The Holst Centre is being established on the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, a science park in an area whose industrial activity has been dominated by electrical and electronics engineering company Royal Philips Electronics. This will give the Holst Centre access to MiPlaza, a microsystems research services organization that belongs to Philips but which is being encouraged to assume a more commercial footing. According to Jo De Boeck, director of wireless autonomous transducer systems at IMEC-NL, a subsidiary of the Belgian organization, the Dutch government has committed 12.5 million [euro] to the start-up phase and first year of the Holst Centre. …",2006.0

The application considers a unique dataset of Costa Rican banks during 1998–2012. We show the usefulness of our tool for corporate governance by examining performance changes around executive turnover.,"This paper proposes a managerial control tool that integrates risk in efficiency measures. Building on existing efficiency specifications, our proposal reflects the real banking technology and accurately models the relationship between desirable and undesirable outputs. Specifically, the undesirable output is defined as non-performing loans to capture credit risk, and is linked only to the relevant dimension of the output set. We empirically illustrate how our efficiency measure functions for managerial control purposes. The application considers a unique dataset of Costa Rican banks during 1998–2012. Results’ implications are mostly discussed at bank-level, and their interpretations are enhanced by using accounting ratios. We also show the usefulness of our tool for corporate governance by examining performance changes around executive turnover. Our findings confirm that appointing CEOs from outside the bank is associated with significantly higher performance ex post executive turnover, thus suggesting the potential benefits of new organisational practices.",2015.0

This mechanism is immune to deviations by single agents, and to deviations by groups of agents of sizes 2, 3 and 4 if side-payments are ruled out. However, if compensations are allowed, groups of agents may have an incentive to jointly deviate from the optimal contract in order to exploit other agents.

158760714,Innovative Trends in Culture in International Business Literature: Toward Multiparadigmatic and Nonlinear Studies of Culture,This article offers four examples of multiparadigmatic studies of culture. It argues that these studies detach culture from its social context.,"AbstractCulture in International Business (CIB) literature has traditionally been dominated by the objectivist tradition, resulting in the following three problems: (1) grounded in the realist ontology, these studies detach culture from its social context, (2) since every paradigm has “blind-spots,” an excessive reliance on one paradigm results in a body of knowledge that is partial at best, and (3) such studies oversimplify culture by reducing it to linear cause–effect relations. Consequently, some scholars have shifted from this dominant trend toward multiparadigmatic studies of culture, some of which are grounded in post-positivism and facilitate nonlinear and asymmetrical analyses of culture. This conceptual article offers four examples of multiparadigmatic studies of culture, which, it argues, offer more innovative insights into cultural phenomena than is possible through monoparadigmatic and linear cause–effect studies.

Our results show that an adverse antitrust review outcome leads to a decline of 2.8% in acquirer firm value. Further, we show that lobbying before deal announcements is associated with more favorable review outcomes. Finally, higher pre-announcement lobbying is valued by shareholders, especially in horizontal deals and deals with a larger expected change in market concentration, which have higher antitrust concerns. However, this positive value effect of lobbying applies only in firms with strong corporate governance. Our results highlight the role of political connections and lobbying for corporate investments when facing regulatory costs and risks.",2018.0

The authors make the case that these three broad processes, while each important in their own right, are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. The article also argues that the complex iteration of financialization in the agrifood sector carries three important implications for the longâ€ term social and ecological sustainability of food and agricultural provisioning: it exacerbates the existing imbalances of power and wealth in the food system; it increases economic and ecological vulnerabilities within agrifood systems; and it has evolved in ways that impede and dampen collective demands for change and resistance.

Two years later, the informality rate had diminished by about 4.0 per-centage points. This paper attempts to estimate how much of this reduction was due to the tax reform, isolating the impact of other macroeconomic variables. A natural approach to perform-ing this task is to apply a difference-in-differences methodology using a household survey panel. Since the Colombian survey does not have a panel structure, we simulated one using a matching difference-in-differences methodology. According to the results, the tax reform is associated with a 4.8-percentage-point decrease in the informality of workers affected by the reform in the thirteen main metropolitan areas. This represents approximately half the reduction of the relevant informality rate during that period, affecting mostly salaried men and workers in general with low levels of education.",2018.0

In developing countries, a lack of access to finance is seen as a key obstacle to successful entrepreneurship and economic growth. However, empirical evidence on this is still fragmented and sparse. This study contributes to the literature by applying an alternative measure of financial constraints based on actual lending and borrowing behavior to test how borrowing affects firm productivity. We use survey data of 615 entrepreneurs from Tanzania to analyze the relationship between financial constraints and labour productivity. Using OLS regression and propensity score matching techniques the results show that financial constraints impede labour productivity and are important barriers to successful entrepreneurship. Further tests suggest that financial constraints matter regardless of the measurement method used, thereby comforting researchers in a fragmented field which applies a wide range of financial constraints variables.",2018.0

158769157,Anatomy of a new dollar van route: Informal transport and planning in New York City,"Dollar vans occupy an awkward space between legal and illegal—some are licensed and some are not, but all dollar vans operate illegally. I argue that dollar van operators follow a similar logic as formal transportation operators when planning service.","Abstract Despite nearly eight million rides per day on formally planned and legally sanctioned buses and subways, dollar vans provide service that shadow some of the busiest bus lines in Brooklyn and Queens. Dollar vans are an informal transport service that occupy an awkward liminal space between legal and illegal—some are licensed and some are not, but all dollar vans operate illegally. It is this legal confusion that renders them informal. It is because of this informality that dollar van operators and drivers can also adapt their routes and service as they deem necessary. This “generative” mode of planning introduces a second dimension of informality; however, I argue that dollar van operators follow a similar logic as formal transportation operators when planning service. I demonstrate this by examining the case of a dollar van operator in Brooklyn developing a new route. I juxtapose his method with that of bus planners from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to show how both groups of planners rely on prompts they encounter, be it anecdotal stories about West Indians in Flatbush moving away or an angry letter from a state legislator, rather than a systematic approach that is taught in classrooms. By examining the planning of a new dollar van route in Brooklyn, I trace the operator's planning process and compare his data against quantitative datasets to show that his generative planning process is supported by the quantitative data and deepens its meaning when combined with his local knowledge. Seen in this light, it is clear that the distance between informal and formal transit is artificial rather than inherent.",2018.0

We find robust evidence that early-stage AD places households at significant risk for large adverse changes in liquid assets.,"Significant limitations and rapid declines in financial capacity are a hallmark of patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). We use linked Health and Retirement Study and Medicare claims data spanning 1992-2014 to examine the effect of early-stage AD, from the start of first symptoms to diagnosis, on household financial outcomes. We estimate household fixed-effects models and examine continuous measures of liquid assets and net wealth, as well as dichotomous indicators for a large change in either outcome. We find robust evidence that early-stage AD places households at significant risk for large adverse changes in liquid assets. Further, we find some, but more limited, evidence that early-stage AD reduces net wealth. Our findings are consequential because financial vulnerability during the disease's early-stage impacts the ability of afflicted individuals and their families to pay for care in the disease's later stage. Additionally, the findings speak to the value that earlier diagnosis may provide by helping avert adverse financial outcomes that occur before the disease is currently diagnosable with available tools. These results also point to a potentially important role for financial institutions in helping reduce exposure of vulnerable elderly to poor outcomes.",2019.0

Of the 82 countries, 58 countries had Ashoka economic social entrepreneur fellows. The control variables include the log of GNI per capita and the log of population. I hypothesised that the less the SPI, the greater the number of social entrepreneurs focusing on the economy. That is, the less the social munificence, the greater the need for social entrepreneurs.",2018.0
150803392,"MINIMUM WAGE AND YOUTH EMPLOYMENT RATES, 2000-2008",This study examines the effect of a minimum wage on youth employment in Spain. It takes into account regional differences and the dynamic behaviour of employment.,"The existence of a universal minimum wage has been, and continues to be, an intensely debated issue. On the one hand, the controversy surrounding a minimum wage appears to be partly justified because the effects of the introduction and increase of a minimum wage may differ greatly depending on the labour market structure. On the other, the current academic literature does not provide clear evidence of which collectives are likely to be more affected in terms of employment by the introduction or increase of a minimum wage. Using the data for the period 2000-2008, this study aims to examine the effect of a minimum wage on youth employment in Spain, taking into account both regional differences and the dynamic behaviour of employment. Unlike previous papers on this subject, we additionally consider the effect of seasonality on employment, a particularly widespread feature of youth employment in Spain. The results obtained in our analysis do not provide clear evidence of any negative effect of a minimum wage on youth employment during the period under study. While this result may point to the existence of a monopsonistic structure of the labour market, the coexistence of increases both in the minimum wage and in youth employment rate during this period could also be explained in the light of a perfectly competitive labour market with a high degree of dynamism and a structural change in employment demand.",2011.0
150805317,Morality and decision making,"A decision is a thought process that leads to one of several possible options. Each option — if chosen and carried out — has consequences for the decision maker or others. That is, the option chosen has a causal effect on things someone cares about, on someone's goals or aims or desires.","A decision is a thought process that leads to one of several possible options. Each option — if chosen and carried out — has consequences for the decision maker or others. That is, the option chosen has a causal effect on things someone cares about, on someone’s goals or aims or desires. By “a causal effect on goals,” I mean that the extent to winch some goal or other is achieved depends on the option chosen. If everything else were held constant except the option chosen, the achievement of goals would vary as a function of the option. Notice that this definition of causality sometimes requires us to ask, counterfactually, what would have happened if some other option had been chosen.",1993.0
